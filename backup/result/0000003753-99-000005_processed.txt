Incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1945, Allen Organ Company and Subsidiaries ("Company") operate in four industry segments: musical instruments, data communications, electronic assemblies, and audio equipment. During October 1998, the Company announced its plans to permanently close its manufacturing plant in Rocky Mount, NC. Rocky Mount Instruments, Inc. (RMI) manufactured small organs and sub-assemblies for the Company's Musical Instruments segment. In December 1998, the Company established Allen Diversified, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of Allen Organ Company to hold and manage the Company's investment in its subsidiary Companies. The Company is developing a line of Public Address System products, which it demonstrated at an industry trade show in January 1999. The Mixer portion of these products utilizes Digital Signal Processor (DSP) technology also used in the Allen digital organs. The speaker technology was developed in conjunction with the Company's subsidiary, Legacy Audio. The product line will initially be targeted at small to mid- sized churches, auditoriums and the like. The Company expects to begin shipping these products in the second half of 1999. Industry segments. The Company operates in four industry segments: musical instruments, data communications, electronic assemblies, and audio equipment. For financial information concerning the segments, see Note 15 to the financial statements. Description of business. Musical Instruments. Allen Organ Company is a leading manufacturer of electronic keyboard musical instruments, primarily digital electronic church organs and accessories. This segment accounted for 57%, 58% and 69% of revenue in 1998, 1997 and 1996 respectively. The principal market for the musical instruments segment are institutions, primarily churches. Sales to the home market make up a smaller portion of the segment's sales. The segment's musical instruments are distributed mostly through dealers, primarily independent retail music stores throughout the United States, with a lesser percentage distributed through dealers internationally. The segment's business is not seasonal. The principal raw materials used in the segment's products are electronic components and wood, all of which are readily available from various sources without undue difficulty. The segment does not engage in any significant amounts of consignments, extended payment terms, or lease guarantees. The Company is contingently liable in connection with certain customers' financing arrangements. See Note 10 to the financial statements. The dollar amounts and number of times the Company has had to honor these repurchase agreements are negligible. The musical instruments segment is not dependent on any single or small group of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business. The dollar amount of the segment's unshipped order backlog at the end of February 1999 and 1998 was $6.3 million and $4.4 million respectively. Approximately $5.7 million of these orders will be filled in the current year with the remaining $600,000 to be filled in the following year. The electronic organ industry is competitive involving at least five (5) domestic and foreign companies. In addition, there are many small pipe organ companies in the institutional organ market. The organ market consists of two basic divisions, institutional (primarily churches) and home or entertainment. The Company believes it has a major position in the institutional market because of product performance and competitive prices, and a smaller percentage of the home or entertainment market. Data Communications. The data communications segment operates through three majority owned subsidiaries, VIR, Inc., Linear Switch Corporation and Eastern Research, Inc. This segment accounted for 27%, 22% and 21% of revenues in 1998, 1997 and 1996 respectively. Data communications products are sold primarily to wholesale and retail distributors worldwide and under OEM agreements with several of its customers. The segment maintains an inventory of in-process and finished goods to allow for rapid fulfillment of customer orders which is expected in the industry. The principal raw material used in the data communications products are electronic components, which are readily available from various sources without undue difficulty. The data communications segment derived 13% and 12% of its 1998 and 1997 revenue from one customer. VIR, Inc. (VIR) and Linear Switch Corporation (LSC) During 1997, these two companies combined their marketing and research & development functions under the name of "VIR Linear Switch". The companies design, manufacture, and market a number of data communication products including patch and testing equipment, often referred to as tech control products, test access equipment and a matrix switch which can transport high-speed digital signals and allow "any-to-any" connectivity between and among connections. The products are of varying complexity and are used to connect, switch, test and trouble shoot data lines in large computer installations. The companies compete in a relatively mature field, producing high quality products at competitive prices. The companies have approximately four major competitors, all of which are larger than VIR/LSC. With the need for higher speed and more reliable communications circuits increasing, VIR/LSC introduced in 1998, a new family of products to provide the ability to access and configure these higher speed circuits for various test procedures. Management is pursuing strategic customer relationships in an effort to expand distribution of its products. The dollar amount of unshipped order backlog at the end of February 1999 and 1998 was $56,000 and $555,000 respectively. All orders are expected to be filled in the current year. Eastern Research, Inc. (ERI) Designs and markets data inter- networking products. These products include direct access equipment that allow users to utilize a broad range of services offered by the telephone companies. ERI competes in a growing market that is in excess of $10 billion. However, the company's current and projected product lines and sales programs are targeted at only a fraction of that market. There are many competitors in this market that is dominated by several large data communications companies, such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Paradyne, Premisys and ADC Kentrox. The company's strategy has been to target existing, yet still growing, market niches with products that provide new features and packaging with attractive pricing. ERI initially built its business in the CSU/DSU market and has also developed router technology products. These products are relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture. Thus, this is a competitive field where margins can erode as new products emerge. During 1998, the company introduced a Frame Aware CSU/DSU that it developed in conjunction with an OEM agreement with one of its customers. ERI is focusing on its DNX (Digital Exchange Network) product line, a narrowband DACS (Digital Access Cross-connect Switch) capable of access speeds from subrate to DS3. The DNX revenues have increased as a percentage of sales and is considered ERI's flagship product. In order to properly capitalize on this market's opportunities, ERI is implementing a more aggressive marketing strategy and is also increasing product development work. This will continue to require further investment through the coming year. ERI has been able to increase sales by working with, and developing strategic customer relationships to expand distribution of its products. One such relationship, which ERI entered into, is an OEM agreement to supply Lucent Technologies with its DACS product line. The dollar amount of unshipped order backlog at the end of February, 1999 and 1998 was $3.0 million and $1.2 million respectively. All orders are expected to be filled in the current year. Electronic Assemblies. Allen Integrated Assemblies (AIA), a division of the Allen Organ Company, provides subcontract manufacture of electronic assemblies for outside customers. The electronic assemblies segment is an outgrowth of the technical skills and manufacturing capabilities developed by the Company in its musical instruments business. This segment accounted for 10%, 15% and 10% of revenue in 1998, 1997, and 1996 respectively. AIA derived 68% of its revenues from three customers in 1998 and 55% and 85% of its revenues from one customer in 1997 and 1996 respectively. The electronic assemblies segment is very competitive with numerous manufacturers capable of producing such products. Customers are generally obtained from a geographic area close to the manufacturer. In order to improve its contract manufacturing capabilities, the segment is upgrading its manufacturing systems and increasing its sales and marketing efforts. The dollar amount of the segment's unshipped order backlog at the end of February 1999 and 1998 was $2.6 million and $3.0 million respectively. All orders are expected to be filled in the current year. Audio Equipment. The Audio Equipment segment began on April 1, 1997 with the acquisition of Legacy Audio, Inc. (LAI) discussed in Note 2 of the Financial Statements. LAI designs, manufactures and markets high-quality audio speaker cabinets for hi-fi stereo and home theater applications. It also markets electronic audio equipment amplifiers that are man  ufactured to its specifications by third party suppliers. This segment accounted for 6% of revenue in 1998 and 5% of revenues for the 9 month period from acquisition to December 31, 1997. The principal market for the audio equipment segment is individual consumers for home use. The segment's products are distributed directly to the customer and through Dealer Audition Sites. This segment's business is not seasonal. LAI's manufacturing facility is currently operating near full capacity. Many of their manufacturing needs are similar to those required in the Company's musical instruments segment. The Company is now building some of LAI's speaker cabinets at its Macungie, PA facility. The principal raw materials used in the segment's products are audio speakers, electronic components and wood, all of which are readily available from various sources without undue difficulty. The company competes with several other high-end audio speaker cabinet manufacturers including Martin- Logan, Thiel, B&W, Celestion, and others. LAI is not dependent on any single, or small group, of customers. The dollar amount of the segment's unshipped order backlog at the end of February 1999 and 1998 was $246,000 and $579,000 respectively. All orders are expected to be filled in the current year. General. The Company's working capital is sufficient to meet the normal expansion of inventory and receivables. The Company spent $3,478,775, $2,654,662, and $2,786,390 annually in 1998, 1997, and 1996 respectively on research and development. The increase in 1998 is a result of the Company's ongoing commitment to new product development and support, primarily at Eastern Research. The decrease in the 1997 expense relates primarily to the combining of the research and development efforts of VIR and LSC. The Company and its subsidiaries employ approximately 544 persons. The Company is not aware of any problem in complying with applicable federal, state, or local provisions with regard to the environment. The manufacturing requirements do not require any special expenditures to meet environmental compliance. Financial information about foreign operations and export sales. The Company does not own manufacturing or sales facilities in any foreign countries. See Note 14 to the financial statements, for additional information on export sales. Export sales are all made in US dollars and for the most part are made under Letter of Credit or on a prepaid basis. The Company has established a Foreign Sales Corporation within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This wholly-owned subsidiary is Allen Organ International, Inc., a Virgin Islands corporation. Item 2.

The 1998, 1997, 1996 and 1995 results of operations include the data communications segment acquired August 1, 1995. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources: The Company continues to maintain a strong financial position and high level of liquidity which enables it to generate funds internally to meet operating needs, capital expenditures and short-term obligations. Key indicators of the Company's liquidity are presented below: December 31, 1998 1997 Working Capital $39,994,941 $42,445,212 Current Ratio 10 to 1 15 to 1 Debt to Equity Ratio .08 to 1 .06 to 1 The Company's ratio of debt to equity has remained very low because of management's continuing policy of financing expansion with internally generated funds. This policy has enabled the Company to maintain its competitive advantage without incurring the costs associated with borrowed funds. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased during 1998 as compared to 1997 primarily due to reductions in inventory in the Musical Instruments and Electronic Assemblies segments. These decreases are the result of improvements in manufacturing methods and inventory management discussed further below. Inventory decreased approximately $3.2 million and $600,000 in the Musical Instruments and Electronic Assemblies segments, respectively, and increased slightly in the Data Communications and Audio Equipment segments. The Company does not expect that inventory levels will change significantly during 1999. Cash flows provided by operating activities declined during 1997 compared to 1996 primarily due to increased working capital requirements, particularly accounts receivable and inventory. These increases were due primarily to new product introductions and higher order volumes in most segments. The Company expects that approximately $2,000,000 will be required in 1999 to fund increases in working capital, primarily related to the growth of its subsidiary Eastern Research. Cash flows used in investing activities during 1998 were used to purchase approximately $925,000 in machinery and equipment to be used in the Musical Instruments and Electronic Assemblies segments including approximately $200,000 for hardware and software related to new information systems. The Data Communications segment used approximately $552,000 primarily related to computer, office and test equipment purchased to support the growth of Eastern Research. To continue Eastern Research's growth through 1999, the Company estimates that capital expenditures will approximate $1,500,000. During 1997 and 1996, cash flows from investing activities were used primarily to fund the purchase of treasury shares. Cash flows from investing activities were also used to fund the acquisition of Legacy Audio, Inc. in April, 1997. During 1997, the company increased its expenditures for property and equipment including approximately $700,000 additional automated equipment and building improvements to enhance its electronics manufacturing capabilities used in the musical instruments and electronic assemblies segments. During December 1998, the Company engaged an outside contractor to upgrade the air handling systems in the wood and metal finishing area of its Macungie, PA plant. This addition is being made to improve product quality for the Company's musical instruments and Legacy speaker cabinet production. The total cost of this project will be approximately $950,000 of which $177,000 has been paid through December 31, 1998. During 1997 the Company began implementing new information systems which will be in place by mid 1999. Through December 31, 1998 the Company has invested nearly $850,000 in software and computer equipment as part of this project. The Company has undertaken this implementation as part of a business improvement program initiated to up- grade production and product planning processes. It is anticipated that these improvements will provide long-term benefits in all areas of the Company. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements regarding new accounting standards. Results of Operations: Sales and Operating Income Consolidated net sales increased $4,617,991 (11%) during 1998 as compared to 1997 primarily due to increased sales in the Musical Instruments segment related to higher order volume and changes in product mix and from the Data Communications segment resulting from additional sales and marketing efforts initiated since the acquisition. In 1997, sales increased $3,632,956 (10%) as compared to 1996 primarily due to sales from the audio equipment segment which was acquired in April, 1997 and increased sales in the data communications segment.

The 1998 order rate exceeded 1997 resulting in an increase in the order backlog at year end of approximately $1,400,000 when compared to 1997. The 1997 decrease in domestic sales reflects lower order rates during the early part of the year. New orders in the fourth quarter of 1997 were approximately $500,000 ahead of the same period in 1996. However, the product mix of these orders required production lead times beyond year end and increased the order backlog at year end by approximately $900,000 when compared to 1996. Export sales decreased in 1998 and 1997, primarily from changes in economic conditions in certain world markets, particularly Far East countries. Continuing economic troubles in foreign countries and foreign exchange rate fluctuations may affect future export sales. Gross profit margins on sales were 24.6%, 28.1% and 31.8% for the three years ended December 31, 1998. The decrease in the 1998 gross profit margin is primarily due to additional costs incurred as part of a business improvement program initiated to up-grade production and product planning processes. As part of this program the Company is implementing new information systems, the majority of which will be in place by mid 1999. The Company at the same time has been improving manufacturing methods and inventory management, which has resulted in a reduction in inventory of approximately $3,200,000 in this segment during 1998. During this process, and in reducing its work-in-process and finished goods inventories, the segment incurred approximately $1,100,000 in additional overheads and expenses related to unapplied labor and related overhead as it trained its work force. By the end of 1997, manufacturing improvements enabled the Company to stop organ production at its North Carolina facility leaving only subassembly production there, consolidating all organ production at the main manufacturing facility in Macungie, PA. The North Carolina plant's remaining production of subassemblies will be phased out in 1999. Increased capabilities at the Macungie, PA facility will allow the Company to meet demand for organs and electronic assemblies. It is anticipated that these business improvements programs will provide long-term benefits to the Company. The decrease in the 1997 gross profit margin is a result of start-up expenses of new organ models introduced in May, 1997, increases in overhead costs and lower sales over which to absorb fixed costs. Selling, administrative, and other expenses increased approximately $230,000 in 1998 due to increased selling costs associated with higher sales volume and implementation and training costs related to the new information systems. Selling, administrative and other expenses increased approximately $200,000 in 1997 as a result of marketing and advertising of new products. Research and development expenses increased approximately $147,000 and $40,000 in 1998 and 1997 respectively. These increases are primarily due to increases in personnel to continue new product development. Data Communications Segment Domestic sales in each of the last two years have increased as a result of additional sales and marketing efforts initiated since the acquisition. International sales for 1998 decreased primarily from changes in economic conditions in certain world markets, particularly Far East countries. The Company has significantly increased its investment in the sales and marketing effort at Eastern Research and will continue to do so in 1999. These additional efforts are focused on expanding channels of distribution and targeting markets for the Company's products. The segment is developing strategic relationships with customers to expand their channels of distribution. One such relationship, which Eastern Research has entered into in February 1999, is an OEM agreement to supply Lucent Technologies with its DACS product line. These relationships could provide additional sales volume in 1999. This segment will continue to invest in sales and marketing programs. Gross profit margins were 41% in 1998 compared to 46% in 1997, a result of competitive pressures on selling prices and variations in product mix. While Eastern Research's gross profit margins have increased during 1998, this increase was offset by lower gross profits at VIR Linear Switch due to lower sales volume. While the companies strive to maintain profit margins by developing products that offer more features, the industry is competitive which often results in pricing changes to obtain and maintain market share. Selling expenses increased approximately $2,000,000 and $500,000 in 1998 and 1997 respectively, reflecting the additional sales and marketing efforts. Selling expenses will continue to increase in the future as sales and marketing programs and personnel are added to further promote the segment's products and obtain additional market share. Administrative expenses increased approximately $518,000 and $550,000 in 1998 and 1997 respectively, resulting from additional management and support personnel added to promote and oversee the segment. Research and development expenses were $2,464,808, $1,799,665 and $1,972,167 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The 1997 decrease is attributed to the combining of the research and development efforts of VIR, Inc. and Linear Switch Corporation. The segment is committed to new product development and support and expects these expenditures to continue to increase during 1999. Electronic Assemblies Segment Sales decreased $1,207,000 during 1998 from lower incoming orders. Sales increased during 1997 and 1996 from higher order volume from existing customers and orders received from several new customers. Gross profit margins were 13.6%, 14.5% and 20.0% for the three years ended December 31, 1998. The decrease is related to competitive pressures common in the industry and the segment's efforts to restructure operations along with the Musical Instruments segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses have increased approximately $86,000 in 1998 as compared to 1997. The segment continues its marketing efforts and has begun to diversify its customer base. The Company continues to improve its production capabilities to offer state of the art manufacturing services to its customers. Audio Equipment Segment Sales for the year ended December 31, 1998 increased approximately 7% when compared to 1997 on a pro forma basis. This increase is a result of greater awareness of the Company through both increased marketing and sales efforts, establishment of Dealer Audition Sites in several markets and positive product reviews in several industry publications during the year. The Company will continue to promote awareness of its products through increased marketing efforts. Gross profit margins were 39.6% and 49.7% for the year ended December 31, 1998 and the nine month period ended 1997, respectively. This decrease is attributable to changes in distribution in certain areas from direct marketing to Dealer Audition Sites. Selling, general and administrative costs increased approximately $360,000 during 1998 as compared to 1997 resulting from increased sales and marketing efforts and additional administrative personnel added to support the company's growth. Other Income (Expense) The decrease in investment income during 1998 is due to lower invested balances, as well as gains on investments recognized in 1997 not recurring in 1998. The variations in investment income in 1997 and 1996 are primarily attributable to the yields available on short-term investments, realized gains, and the amounts of principal invested. The 1998, 1997, and 1996 amounts include $242,227, $765,109 and $287,982 of realized capital gains respectively. Interest expense represents interest on the notes payable issued in connection with the acquisition of VIR, Inc. and Eastern Research, Inc. Income Taxes The increase in the effective tax rate related to the 1998 tax benefit is due to higher effective state tax rates applicable to the Data Communications segments which incurred losses during 1998. The decrease in the 1997 tax provision is attributable to a decrease in the estimated effective tax rate for the current and prior tax year resulting from a change in state revenue allocations. Factors that May Affect Operating Results The statements contained in this report on Form 10-K that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements regarding the Company's expectations, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding the future. Forward looking statements include: statements regarding future products or product development; statements regarding future research and development spending and the Company's marketing and product development strategy, statements regarding future production capacity. All forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the Company on the date hereof, and the Company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which reflect management's opinions only as of the date hereof. Readers should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents the Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed by the Company in fiscal year 1999. It is important to note that the Company's actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth below. The Company has experienced and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its results of operations. Factors that affect the Company's results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received, changes in the mix of products sold, market acceptance of the Company's and its customer's products, competitive pricing pressures, global currency valuations, the Company's ability to meet increasing demand, the Company's ability to introduce new products on a timely basis, the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the Company or its competitors, changing customer requirements, delays in new product qualifications, the timing and extent of research and development expenses and fluctuations in manufacturing yields. As a result of the foregoing or other factors, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

ALLEN ORGAN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 Significant Accounting Policies Background: Allen Organ Company and Subsidiaries operate in four industry segments: musical instruments, data communications, electronic assemblies, and audio equipment. See note 15 for additional information on the operating activities of each segment. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Allen Organ Company and the following subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Subsidiary Name Ownership % Allen Diversified, Inc. 100.00% Rocky Mount Instruments, Inc. 100.00% Allen Organ International, Inc. 100.00% VIR, Inc. 98.59% Eastern Research, Inc. 92.52% Linear Switch Corporation 92.20% Legacy Audio, Inc. 75.00% In December 1998 the Company established Allen Diversified, Inc. to hold and manage the Company's investments in its subsidiaries. Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the 1997 and 1996 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 1998 presentation. Off-Balance Sheet Risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of short-term investments and trade receivables. The Company places substantially all of its investments in mutual funds holding federal, state and local government obligations and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure in any one investment. The Company sells most of its products through established dealer networks. The credit risk associated with related receivables is limited due to the large number of dealers and their geographic dispersion. Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Investments: The Company accounts for its short-term investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first- out (FIFO) method for substantially all inventories. Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed over estimated useful asset lives using both straight-line and accelerated methods for financial reporting and accelerated methods for tax reporting. Goodwill and Intangibles: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net assets of acquired subsidiaries. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over various periods from 3 - 20 years and is presented net of accumulated amortization of $782,850 and $348,862 at December 31, 1998 and 1997 respectively. The carrying value of goodwill for each business is continually reviewed to assess its recoverability from future operations of the acquired subsidiaries, based on future cash flows (undiscounted) expected to be generated by such operations. Any impairment in value indicated by the assessment would be charged against current operations. During 1997 the Company re-evaluated the useful life of goodwill acquired through business acquisitions and began amortizing the goodwill associated with acquisitions over useful lives of 3 - 20 years. Previously, goodwill was being amortized over 40 years. This change in the estimated life of the goodwill had the effect of decreasing net income for 1997 by approximately $60,000 ($0.05 per share). Intangible assets consisted of organization costs (presented net of accumulated amortization of $134,225 at December 31, 1997) which are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over ten years. Inaccordance with the AICPA Accounting Standards Executive Committee Statement of Position, 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities, the net book value of these organizational costs was expensed in 1998, as acumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Income Taxes: Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are recognized for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. Research and Development: Research and development expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Stock-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Since the Company is not required to adopt the fair value based recognition provisions prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, it has elected only to comply with the disclosure requirements set forth in the Statement. (See Note 17.) Year 2000: The Year 2000 issue relates to the ability of computer systems, microprocessors and other electronic devices to deal appropriately with dates on or after January 1, 2000. The effect of the Year 2000 issue may include computer failures and business interruption. The Company has taken action to make its systems, products and infrastructure Year 2000 compliant. The Company began work several years ago to prepare its products and its financial information and other computer-based systems for the Year 2000, including replacing and/or updating existing systems. Internally the Company is in the process of implementing new, Year 2000 compliant, information systems that are expected to be in place by mid 1999. Externally, the Company has surveyed its suppliers, financial institutions, and other organizations that may impact the Company's operation to assess their level of Year 2000 compliance. The Company will continue to monitor its Year 2000 compliance program, address any material issues and develop contingency plans, as it deems appropriate. While the Company has and will take steps to address material Year 2000 issues, the failure to identify or correct a material internal or external Year 2000 problem could result in an interruption in the Company's business operations. While these Year 2000 efforts will involve additional costs, the Company believes, based on available information, that it will be able to manage its total Year 2000 transition without any material adverse effect on its business operations, products or financial condition. Change in Accounting Policies: Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted the AICPA Accounting Standards Executive Committee Statement of Position, 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities, (SOP 98-5). In accordance with SOP 98-5, costs associated with start-up activities, including organizational costs, should be expensed as incurred. The effect of the change resulted in a decrease to net income of $287,809 (net of taxes of $183,000). These amounts were a result of unamortized organizational costs associated with the acquisitions of the Data Communications and Audio Equipment segments. During 1998, the Company also adopted the following new Statements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These Statements did not have a material effect on the Company's financial Statements. SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income - establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements. SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information - establishes standards for reporting selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services. SFAS 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post Retirement Benefits - revises disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefit plans. NOTE 2 Business Acquisitions Legacy Audio: On April 1, 1997 the Company purchased a 75% interest in Legacy Audio in exchange for $1,512,000 in cash. In connection with the acquisition, the company established a new subsidiary, Legacy Audio, Inc. (LAI), to acquire the assets of the seller. A founding owner of the seller contributed the remaining 25% of the assets of the seller to the new company in exchange for a 25% interest in LAI. Additionally, this founding owner has been named the President and Chief Designer of LAI. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The results of operations of LAI have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets and liabilities have been recorded at their estimated fair market values with the excess being recorded as goodwill which will be amortized over periods from 10 - 20 years. The following pro forma financial information has been prepared giving effect to the acquisition of Legacy Audio, Inc. as if the transaction had taken place at the beginning of the respective year. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations which would have been attained had the acquisitions been consummated on any of the foregoing dates or which may be attained in the future. Years Ended December 31, 1997 1996 Pro forma Net Sales $40,809,887 $38,681,238 Pro forma Net Income 3,490,772 3,889,960 Pro forma Net Income Per Share $2.77 $2.90 NOTE 3 Plant Closing In October 1998 the Company announced plans to permanently close its manufacturing plant in Rocky Mount, NC. Rocky Mount Instruments, Inc. (RMI) manufactured small organs and sub- assemblies for the Company's Musical Instruments segment. The Company expects to terminate a total of  60 people by June 30, 1999. 28 employees had been terminated as of December 31, 1998.

Under the terms of an agreement with the wife of the late Chairman and principal shareholder, the Company may be required to purchase within eight months of her death, at the option of her personal representative, an amount of Class B Common Shares then owned by her or includable in her estate for Federal Estate Tax purposes sufficient to pay estate taxes and costs, subject to the limitations of Section 303 of the Internal Revenue Code. At December 31, 1998, the shareholder owned or would have includable in her estate 261,072 shares of Class B Common Stock. The Company has purchased life insurance on the life of the shareholder with a face value of $6,000,000. Management believes that the insurance proceeds would be sufficient to substantially fund this possible future commitment and that any excess would not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company. During December 1998, the Company engaged an outside contractor to upgrade the air handling systems in the wood and metal finishing area of its Macungie, PA plant. This addition is being made to improve product quality for the Company's musical instruments and Legacy speaker cabinet production. The total cost of this project will be approximately $950,000 of which $177,000 has been paid through December 31, 1998. In connection with the purchase of VIR, Eastern Research and Linear Switch, the Company agreed to pay a contingent purchase price equal to 4.5% of the sales of these Companies in excess of $7,000,000 per year through December 2000. The total contingent payment for 1998, 1997 and 1996 amounted to $238,535, $92,432 and $29,142, respectively. The agreement provides that the total of the contingent payments shall not exceed $2,000,000. The Company's data communications segment leases its offices and production facility under non-cancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through February, 2001. These leases include renewal options for periods ranging from two to fifteen years with increases of lease payments based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. Rent expense was $230,447, $179,765 and $169,493 for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Minimum annual rent payments for the operating leases are as follows: 1999 $ 236,320 2000 199,220 2001 24,220 Total $ 459,760 NOTE 11 Retirement Plans The Company sponsors two noncontributory defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all of its employees. Salaried plan benefits are generally based on the employee's years of service and compensation levels. Hourly plan benefits are based on various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. The Company's funding policy is to contribute amounts to the plans sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate from time to time. Plan assets are comprised principally of cash equivalents, U.S. Government obligations, fixed income securities, and equity securities.
