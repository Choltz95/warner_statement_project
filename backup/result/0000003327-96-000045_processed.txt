Portions of proxy statement and notice of annual meeting of stockholders on January 23, 1997 -1- PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION Alberto-Culver Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (herein referred to collectively as the "company", unless indicated otherwise) have two principal business segments. One segment, "Consumer Products" principally includes developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing branded consumer products worldwide and includes the company's Alberto-Culver USA and Alberto- Culver International business units. This segment also includes products intended for end use by institutions and industries and the manufacturing of custom label products for other companies. The second segment, "Specialty Distribution - -Sally", consists of Sally Beauty Company, a specialty distributor of professional beauty supplies with 1,656 stores as of September 30, 1996 in the United States, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany. In February 1996, the company acquired St. Ives Laboratories, Inc. (St. Ives) for approximately $110 million. St. Ives develops, manufactures and markets personal care products under its SWISS FORMULA brand and manufactures custom label products for sale by other companies. Financial information about business segments and geographic area information is incorporated herein by reference to the Business Segments and Geographic Area Information note of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in the registrant's annual report to stockholders for the year ended September 30, 1996. PRODUCTS The classes of products in the "Consumer Products" business segment include health and beauty care products and food and household products. Health and beauty care products accounted for approximately 43%, 39% and 39% of the company's consolidated net sales for the years ended September 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Food and household products accounted for approximately 8%, 10% and 9% of the company's consolidated net sales for the years ended September 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The company's major health and beauty care products in the United States include the ALBERTO VO5, TRESemme and CONSORT lines of hair care products, the St. Ives SWISS FORMULA line of hair and skin care products, FDS feminine deodorant sprays and the TCB line of hair care products for the ethnic market. Food and household products sold in the United States include MRS. DASH salt-free seasonings, MOLLY McBUTTER dairy sprinkles, SUGARTWIN sugar substitute and STATIC GUARD anti-static spray. The company sold its Milani, Diafoods, Thick-It and Smithers institutional food lines in July, 1996. The company's consumer products are sold in more than 100 countries. Through its Cederroth subsidiary, the company manufactures and markets health and beauty care products throughout Scandanavia and Europe. Major products include SALVEKVICK adhesive bandages, ALBERTO VO5 hair care products, SAMARIN antacids, SELTIN salt substitute, LACTACYD liquid soap, TOPZ cotton buds, BLIW liquid soaps, DATE anti-perspirants and cologne for women, FAMILY FRESH shampoo and shower products, SUKETTER artificial sweetener, HEMANENT home permanents, HTH and L300 skin care products and GRUMME TVATTSAPA detergents. In the United Kingdom, the company markets, among other products, the ALBERTO VO5 line of hair care products, the St. Ives SWISS FORMULA line of hair and skin care products, ALBERTO BALSAM shampoo and conditioner and the TRESemme line of hair care products. INDOLA professional color bleaches, shampoos, conditioners and styling products are sold throughout Europe and other international markets. Other major international markets include Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand and Puerto Rico. - 2 - The "Specialty Distribution - Sally" business segment represents the operations of Sally Beauty Company, Inc. which operates a network of cash-and- carry professional beauty supply stores and also sells professional beauty products to hairdressers, beauticians and cosmetologists through its own full- service distributors. Sally stores provide salon owners, hairdressers and consumers with an extensive selection of hair care and skin care products, cosmetics, styling appliances and other beauty items. Sales of the "Specialty Distribution - Sally" business segment accounted for approximately 49%, 51% and 52% of the company's consolidated net sales for the years ended September 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Many of the company's consumer products are developed in the company's laboratories. New products introduced by the company are assigned product managers who guide the products from development to the consumer. The product managers are responsible for the overall marketing plans for the products and coordinate advertising, promotion and market research activities. MARKETING The company allocates a large portion of its revenues to advertising, promotion and market research. Net earnings for all periods are materially affected by advertising, promotion and market research expenditures. These expenditures are charged to income in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising, promotion and market research expenditures were $208.4 million in 1996, $188.0 million in 1995 and $178.5 million in 1994. Advertising, promotion, and market research expenditures relating to a new product will ordinarily constitute a higher percentage of sales than in the case of a well-established product. There can be no assurance that such expenditures will result in consumer acceptance and profitability for a product. The company regards television as the best medium for its advertising and uses it to conduct extensive network, spot and cable television advertising campaigns. The company also advertises through other media such as newspapers, magazines and radio as well as through Sally Beauty Company's direct mailings to professional customers. Extensive advertising and promotion are required to build and protect a product's market position. The company believes there is significant consumer awareness of its major brands and that such awareness is an important factor in the company's operating results. COMPETITION The markets for the company's branded consumer products are highly competitive and sensitive to changes in consumer preferences and demands. The company's competitors range in size from large, highly diversified companies (some of which have substantially greater financial resources than the company) to small, specialized producers. The company competes on the basis of product quality and price and believes that brand loyalty and consumer acceptance are important factors. The company's markets are characterized by frequent introductions of competitive products and by the entry of other manufacturers as new competitors, both typically accompanied by extensive advertising and promotional campaigns. Such campaigns are often very costly and can significantly affect the sales and earnings of the company and its competitors. Sally Beauty Company experiences competition from local and regional professional beauty supply stores, full-service dealers calling directly on salons and a wide range of retail outlets carrying a limited selection of professional beauty products. DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES Retail health and beauty care products and food and household products are sold in the United States primarily through the company's sales force of approximately 68 employees and 122 food brokers calling upon wholesale drug establishments and retail outlets such as supermarkets, drug stores, mass merchandisers and variety stores. Hair care products for the professional trade in the United States are sold by company sales representatives and brokers to beauty supply outlets and to beauty distributors who in turn sell to beauty salons, barber shops and beauty schools. - 3 -  Sally Beauty Company sells its professional beauty supplies through full-service distributors and its 1,656 stores located in 46 states, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany. Sally's stores are self-service, cash-and-carry and are primarily located in shopping centers. Sally operates the world's largest chain of professional beauty supply stores and as such is a major customer of some of the company's competitors in the personal care products industry. Sally sells the company's professional hair care products, but these products represent only a small portion of Sally's selection of salon brands. FOREIGN OPERATIONS Products of the company are sold in more than 100 countries or geographic regions, primarily through direct sales by subsidiaries, independent distributors and licensees. The company's foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in transactions involving foreign currencies and fluctuating exchange rates. EMPLOYEES In its domestic and foreign operations, the company had approximately 10,700 full-time equivalent employees as of September 30, 1996, consisting of 6,200 hourly personnel and 4,500 salaried employees. At September 30, 1995, the company had approximately 9,900 full-time equivalent employees. The increase in employees in fiscal year 1996 is principally due to the growth in the number of Sally Beauty Company stores and the acquisition of St. Ives Laboratories, Inc. Certain subsidiaries of the company have union contracts covering production, warehouse, shipping and maintenance personnel. The company considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory. REGULATION The company is subject to the regulations of several federal and state agencies, including the Federal Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission. TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS The company's trademarks, certain of which are material to its business, are registered or legally protected in the United States, Canada and other countries throu  ghout the world in which products of the company are sold. Although the company owns patents and has other patent applications pending, its business is not materially dependent upon patents or patent protection. - 4 -  ITEM 2.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management believes these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. CASH EQUIVALENTS All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. These investments are stated at cost which approximates market value. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS Short-term investments are stated at cost which is equal to market value at September 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively. INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method or retail method) or market (net realizable value). PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided primarily on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. GOODWILL AND TRADE NAMES The cost of goodwill and trade names is amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from ten to forty years. Management periodically considers whether there has been a permanent impairment to the value of goodwill and trade names by evaluating various factors including current operating results, market and economic conditions and anticipated future results and cash flows. Accumulated amortization at September 30, 1996 and 1995, was $17.3 million and $12.9 million respectively. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Foreign currency balance sheet accounts are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates during the period. The following is an analysis of changes in the foreign currency translation account: (Thousands) 1996 1995 Balance, beginning of year $(12,966) (11,793) Foreign currency translation loss (462) (1,173) Balance, end of year $(13,428) (12,966) Realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions included in the consolidated statements of earnings resulted in losses of $17,000, $359,000 and $323,000 in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. ADVERTISING, PROMOTION AND MARKET RESEARCH  Advertising, promotion and market research costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $208.4 million, $188.0 million and $178.5 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. INCOME TAXES Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are estimated to be recovered or settled. CALCULATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE Primary earnings per share are based on the weighted average shares outstanding, including common stock equivalents, of 28,213,000 in 1996, 27,849,000 in 1995 and 28,042,000 in 1994. Fully-diluted earnings per share are determined by dividing net earnings plus the interest expense on the convertible subordinated debentures (net of tax benefit) by the weighted average shares outstanding, including common stock equivalents, after giving effect for common shares to be issued assuming conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures to common shares. Fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 31,388,000 in 1996, 28,576,000 in 1995 and 28,081,000 in 1994. (2) Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses consist of the following: (Thousands) 1996 1995 Compensation and be $ 48,960 31,597 Advertising and promotions 28,085 21,320 Other 38,094 23,224 --------- ------- $115,139 76,141 (3) Debt and Other Financing Arrangements Long-term debt, exclusive of current maturities, consists of the following: (Thousands) 1996 1995 5.5% convertible subordinated debentures due June, 2005 $100,000 100,000 Term notes payable: 9.73% due November, 1998 ---- 20,000 6.2% due September, 2000 20,000 20,000 Revolving Swedish krona credit agreements at 5.3% - 11.7% 39,200 40,302 Other, principally foreign borrowings and capitalized leases, at weighted average interest rates of 8.2% in 1996 and 9.0% in 1995 2,348 2,792 --------- -------- $161,548 183,094  Notes Continued Maturities of debt for the next five years are as follows (in thousands): 1997 - $1,313; 1998 - $1,172; 1999 - $558; 2000 - $59,433; 2001- $175 and later - - $100,210. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its recorded value. In July, 1995, the company issued $100 million of 5.5% convertible subordinated debentures maturing on June 30, 2005. The debentures are convertible into Class A common shares at a conversion rate of 30.888 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $32-3/8). The debentures are redeemable, in whole but not in part, at the option of the company any time on or after June 30, 1998 at par plus accrued interest. In August, 1996, the company prepaid $20 million of 9.73% term notes scheduled to mature in November, 1998 and incurred a prepayment penalty. Due to immateriality, the penalty is not reported as an extraordinary item, but is included in net interest expense. The term notes due September, 2000 impose restrictions on such items as total debt, working capital, dividend payments, treasury stock purchases and interest expense. At September 30, 1996, the company was in compliance with these arrangements and $132.5 million of consolidated retained earnings was not restricted as to the payment of dividends or purchases of treasury stock. The company had available lines of credit of approximately $109 million with various banks at September 30, 1996. The credit lines, which require no compensating balances, may be terminated at the option of the banks or the company. In January, 1996, the company entered into an agreement to sell, without recourse, up to $30 million of a designated pool of trade receivables on an ongoing basis. The agreement expires in one year and is renewable annually upon the mutual consent of both parties. At September 30, 1996, the facility was fully utilized. Costs related to this agreement are included in administrative expenses. (4) Treasury Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital Changes in treasury stock and additional paid-in capital during 1996, 1995 and 1994 were as follows: Additional Treasury Stock Paid-In (Thousands) Shares Amount Capital Balance at September 30, 1993 5,842 $ 36,392 $ 87,262 Stock options exercised .....

(25) (306) 371 Balance at September 30,1996 6,392 $ 48,483 $ 88,955 The company has two classes of common stock, both of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Except for voting, dividend and conversion rights, the Class A and Class B common stock are identical. Class A has one-tenth vote per share and Class B has one vote per share. No dividend may be paid on the Class B unless an equal or greater dividend is paid on the Class A, and dividends may be paid on the Class A in excess of dividends paid, or without paying  dividends, on the Class B. All, and not less than all, of the Class A may at any time be converted into Class B on a share-for-share basis at the option of the company. The Class B is convertible into Class A on a share-for-share basis at the option of the holders. Cash dividends for Class B common stock in 1996, 1995 and 1994 were $5.9 million or $.35 per share, $5.2 million or $.31 per share and $4.6 million or $.275 per share, respectively. Cash dividends for Class A common stock in 1996, 1995 and 1994 were $3.9 million or $.35 per share, $3.4 million or $.31 per share and $3.1 million or $.275 per share, respectively. Class A common stock dividends per share have been equal to those of Class B common stock since the Class A shares were issued in April, 1986. (5) Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans Pursuant to its stock option plans, the company is authorized to issue non-qualified options to employees and directors to purchase a limited number of shares of the company's Class A common stock at a price not less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options under the plans expire five or ten years from date of grant and are exercisable on a cumulative basis in four equal annual increments commencing one year after the date of grant. Shares under option at September 30, 1996 are summarized as follows: Shares Per Share Total Year Under Option Option Price Granted Option Price (Thousands) 1989 4,250 $13.25 $ 56 1990 69,366 18.75 1,301 1991 33,250 19.88 661 1992 109,800 21.50 - 23.65 2,371 1993 136,875 23.69 - 26.06 3,252 1994 183,750 19.50 - 21.63 3,616 1995 462,358 23.69 10,952 1996 494,800 26.75 - 34.13 13,462 1,494,449 $35,671 Options for 83,442 shares were exercised in 1996 whereas options for 32,634 shares were exercised in the prior year. During 1996 and 1995, options for 52,675 and 35,525 shares, respectively, were terminated. Options for 526,787 shares were exercisable at September 30, 1996. The company is also authorized to grant shares of Class A common stock to employees under its restricted stock plan. The restricted shares vest on a cumulative basis in four equal annual installments commencing four years after the date of grant. At September 30, 1996, there were 40,500 restricted shares outstanding.  Notes Continued (6) Income Taxes The provisions for income taxes consist of the following: (Thousands) 1996 1995 1994 Current: Federal $27,651 20,820 19,477 Foreign 5,566 5,310 3,768 State 5,911 5,218 3,923 ------- ------- ------- 39,128 31,348 27,168 Deferred: Federal (2,349) (213) (1,315) Foreign 1,268 561 974 State (777) (105) 183 (1,858) 243 (158) -------- ------- ------- $37,270 31,591 27,010 The difference between the effective income tax rate and the United States statutory federal income tax rate is summarized below: 1996 1995 1994 Statutory tax rate  35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Effect of foreign income tax rates (1.5) (1.0) .1 State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 3.3 3.9 3.7 Other, net .5 (.4) (.8) Effective tax rate 37.3% 37.5% 38.0% Significant components of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 1996 and 1995 are as follows: (Thousands) ....................................... 1996 1995 Deferred tax assets attributable to: Accrued expenses ................................. $15,802 5,220 Inventory adjustments ............................ 2,045 -- Total deferred tax assets ........................ 17,847 5,220 Deferred tax liabilities attributable to: Depreciation and amortization .............. 15,785 13,956 Inventory adjustments ...................... -- 983 State income taxes ......................... 18 1,095 Other ...................................... 479 313 Total deferred tax liabilities .................... 16,582 16,347 Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) ............. $ 1,265 (11,127) Prepaid expenses at September 30, 1996 and 1995 include $17.8 million and $4.2 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets. Domestic earnings before income taxes were $77.9 million, $72.0 million and $62.3 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Foreign operations had earnings before income taxes of $22.1 million, $12.2 million and $8.8 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Undistributed earnings of the company's foreign operations amounting to $99.3 million are intended to remain permanently invested to finance future growth and expansion. Accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided on those earnings at September 30, 1996. Should such earnings be distributed, the credit for foreign income taxes paid would substantially offset applicable U.S. income taxes.  (7) Lease Commitments The major portion of the company's leases are for Sally Beauty Company stores. Other leases cover certain manufacturing and warehousing properties, office facilities, data processing equipment and automobiles. At September 30, 1996, future minimum payments under noncancelable leases are as follows: Operating Capital (Thousands) Leases Leases 1997 $ 39,160 1,031 1998 29,498 746 1999 20,846 211 2000 13,093 101 2001 6,435 17 2002 and later 7,469 -- Total minimum lease payments $116,501 2,106 Total rental expense for operating leases amounted to $53.0 million in 1996, $47.4 million in 1995 and $44.2 million in 1994. Certain leases require the company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and special assessments.  (8) Business Segments and Geographic Area Information The "consumer products" business segment principally includes developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing branded consumer products worldwide and includes the company's Alberto-Culver USA and Alberto-Culver International business units. This segment also includes products intended for end use by institutions and industries and the manufacturing of custom label products for other companies. The "specialty distribution - Sally" business segment consists of Sally Beauty Company, a specialty distributor of professional beauty supplies. Segment and geographic data for the years ended September 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994 are as follows: (9) Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of earnings information for the years ended September 30, 1996 and 1995 are summarized below (in thousands, except per share amounts): (10) Acquisitions and Divestiture In April, 1995, the company's Sweden-based subsidiary, Cederroth International AB, completed the acquisition of the Toiletries Division of Molnlycke AB. The acquired division develops, manufactures and markets body and skin care, hair care, oral care and household products in Scandinavia. The acquisition, valued at approximately $50 million, was accounted for as a purchase and was funded with local bank borrowings payable in Swedish krona. The operations of the Molnlycke Toiletries business have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements since April, 1995. Had Molnlycke Toiletries been acquired at the beginning of fiscal year 1994, the pro-forma inclusion of its operating results would not have had a significant effect on the reported consolidated net earnings for the two year period ended September 30, 1995. In February, 1996, the company acquired St. Ives Laboratories, Inc. ("St. Ives") for approximately $110 million. St. Ives develops, manufactures and markets personal care products under its Swiss Formula brand and manufactures custom label products for other companies. The purchase of St. Ives was funded with the net proceeds available from the July, 1995 issuance  of $100 million of 5.5% convertible subordinated debentures and from the sale of certain trade accounts receivable in January, 1996. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the operating results of St. Ives have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired of approximately $47 million is being amortized over 40 years. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the years ended September 30, 1996 and 1995 assume the St. Ives acquisition occurred as of October 1, 1994 (in thousands, except per share data): 1996 1995 Net sales $1,647,063 1,518,487 Net earning 63,056 48,875 Earnings per share: Primary 2.23 1.76 Fully-diluted 2.12 1.74 In July, 1996, Alberto-Culver USA sold its Milani, DiaFoods, Thick-It and Smithers institutional food lines and granted the purchaser a master distribution license to sell the company's other institutional food products. The transaction resulted in an immaterial gain and is included in administrative expense. Independent Auditors' Report The Board of Directors and Stockholders Alberto-Culver Company: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alberto  -Culver Company and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, retained earnings and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 1996. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alberto-Culver Company and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Chicago, Illinois October 23, 1996 KPMG Peat Marwick LLP  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Alberto-Culver Company and Subsidiaries RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal year 1996 marked the company's thirteenth consecutive year of record sales. Net sales for the year ended September 30, 1996 were $1.59 billion, an increase of 17.1% over prior year sales of $1.36 billion. Net sales in 1994 were $1.22 billion. Record net earnings of $62.7 million in 1996 increased 19.2% from 1995 net earnings of $52.7 million. Primary earnings per share of $2.22 were 33 cents or 17.5% higher than 1995. Fully-diluted earnings per share were $2.11, an increase of 24 cents or 12.8% from 1995. Net earnings in 1994 were $44.1 million or $1.57 per share on a primary and fully-diluted basis. Prior to 1996, the Consumer Products Division of Alberto-Culver USA recorded certain promotional allowances that were shown as a deduction from the list price reported on customer invoices as promotion expenses. Effective October 1, 1995, the division changed its method of reporting to a net sales basis thereby reducing sales and promotion expense by $12.6 million for 1996. This change had no effect on net income and prior periods have not been reclassified due to immateriality. The change is in conformity with industry practice and also provides management with financial information that is consistent across other divisions of Alberto-Culver USA and Alberto-Culver International. Sales of Alberto-Culver USA consumer products in 1996 were $377.5 million, an increase of 23.5% from prior year sales of $305.7 million. The 1996 increase primarily resulted from the acquisition of St. Ives Laboratories, Inc. ("St. Ives") in February, 1996, which added $87.7 million of sales, partially offset by lower sales due to the change in the classification of certain off-invoice promotional allowances discussed above. In 1995, sales increased 4.1% from 1994 sales of $293.7 million primarily due to higher sales of Alberto VO5 and TRESemme shampoo and conditioner products, FDS feminine deodorant spray and Mrs. Dash seasoning products, partially offset by lower sales for the Alberto, Alberto VO5 and Bold Hold hair styling lines and the discontinuation of Village Saucerie sauce and recipe mixes. Alberto-Culver International consumer products sales were $452.0 million in 1996 compared to $363.3 million in 1995 and $300.6 million in 1994. The sales increases in 1996 and 1995 primarily resulted from acquisitions. The Toiletries Division of Sweden-based Molnlycke AB was purchased in April, 1995 and St. Ives was acquired in February, 1996. Sales of the "Specialty distribution - Sally" business segment increased to $771.9 million in 1996 compared to $697.7 million and $631.5 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The higher sales in 1996 were attributable to sales gains for established Sally Beauty Company outlets and the addition of 162 stores during the year. The number of Sally stores increased 34.1% over the last three years to a total of 1,656 at the end of 1996 compared to 1,494 and 1,363 at the end of 1995 and 1994, respectively. Cost of products sold as a percentage of sales was 50.6% in fiscal year 1996 compared to 50.3% in 1995 and 49.6% in 1994. The increase in the cost of products sold percentage over the last three years primarily resulted from changes in product mix, higher raw material costs and the 1996 addition of St. Ives' custom label business which has a higher cost of goods sold percentage. In 1996, the cost of products sold percentage was also higher due to the reduction in sales resulting from the change in recording certain off-invoice promotional allowances. Advertising, promotion, selling and administrative expenses increased 15.1% in 1996 and 9.0% in 1995. The increase in 1996 resulted from the acquisition of St. Ives in February, 1996, the inclusion of the operations of Molnlycke Toiletries for a full year, higher selling and administrative costs associated with the increase in the number of Sally Beauty Company stores and the discount on the sale of certain trade receivables. These increases were partially offset by an immaterial, non-recurring gain on the sale of certain Alberto-Culver USA institutional food lines in July, 1996. The higher costs in 1995 were primarily due to selling and administrative costs associated with the increase in the number of Sally stores and higher advertising and promotional expenditures for consumer products.  Advertising, promotion and market research expenditures were $208.4 million, $188.0 million and $178.5 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The increase in 1996 mainly resulted from the acquisition of St. Ives in February, 1996 and the inclusion of the operations of Molnlycke Toiletries for a full year, partially offset by the reclassification of certain off-invoice promotional allowances. Interest expense, net of interest income, was $12.1 million, $6.5 million and $5.9 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Interest expense was $15.9 million in 1996 versus $9.9 million in 1995 and $8.6 million in 1994. The increase in interest expense in 1996 was attributable to the convertible subordinated debentures and borrowings related to the Molnlycke acquisition being outstanding for the full year along with the penalty incurred on the August, 1996 prepayment of the $20 million, 9.73% term notes. These increases were mitigated by the elimination of interest expense on the $30.0 million of term loans retired in July, 1995. Interest income was $3.8 million, $3.4 million and $2.8 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The increases in 1996 and 1995 principally resulted from investing the July, 1995 net proceeds of the $100 million convertible subordinated debentures until the funds were used for the acquisition of St. Ives in February, 1996. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes was 37.3%, 37.5% and 38.0% in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Factors which influenced the effective tax rates for those years are described in "note 6" to the consolidated financial statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION Working capital at September 30, 1996 was $226.1 million, a decrease of $75.6 million from the prior year's working capital of $301.7 million. The resulting current ratio was 1.79 to 1.00 at September 30, 1996 compared to 2.28 to 1.00 last year. The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of St. Ives in February, 1996, the prepayment of the $20 million term notes in August, 1996, capital expenditures and dividend payments, partially offset by the net after-tax proceeds from the sale of certain Alberto-Culver USA institutional food lines in July, 1996 and cash provided by operating activities. Accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable were $259.6 million at September 30, 1996 compared to $232.8 million last year. The increase was primarily due to inventories needed to support the 10.8% increase in the number of Sally stores in 1996 and the acquisition of St. Ives in February, 1996, partially offset by the sale of $30 million of certain trade accounts receivable in January, 1996. Prepaid expenses in 1996 increased $14.4 million to $26.9 million primarily due to current deferred tax assets. Components of deferred tax assets are described in "note 6" to the consolidated financial statements. Net property, plant and equipment increased $18.1 million to $175.9 million at September 30, 1996. The increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of St. Ives, additional Sally stores, a new Sally warehouse and other capital expenditures for machinery, equipment and information systems. Goodwill and trade names, net of amortization, increased $130.2 million over the last two years to a total of $184.5 million as of September 30, 1996. The primary reasons for the increase were the acquisitions of St. Ives in 1996 and the Toiletries Division of Molnlycke AB in 1995. Long-term debt decreased $21.5 million principally due to the August, 1996 prepayment of the $20 million, 9.73% term notes which were scheduled to mature in November, 1998. Total stockholders' equity increased $54.2 million to $425.1 million at September 30, 1996, primarily due to net earnings for the fiscal year partially offset by dividend payments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The company's primary sources of cash over the past three years have been funds provided by  operating activities and the July, 1995 issuance of convertible subordinated debentures. Operating activities provided cash of $92.7 million, $81.8 million and $65.4 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The company has obtained long-term financing as needed to fund acquisitions and other growth opportunities. As evidenced by the issuance of the $100 million of convertible subordinated debentures in July, 1995, funds are occasionally obtained prior to their actual need in order to take advantage of opportunities in the debt markets. The company also obtained funds in 1996 through the sale of $30 million of trade accounts receivable. Under existing debt covenants, the company has the ability to enter into new financing arrangements aggregating up to $685 million. At September 30, 1996, the company had available lines of credit of $109 million with various financial institutions. The credit lines, which require no compensating balances, may be terminated at the option of the respective banks or the company. The primary uses of cash have been to repay long-term debt and fund acquisitions. Over the three year period ending September 30, 1996, debt repayments exceeded proceeds from new borrowings, excluding the convertible subordinated debentures, by $44.4 million. Other major uses of cash during the three year period included payments for acquired companies of $180.2 million, capital expenditures of $98.1 million, cash dividends of $26.0 million and common stock purchases for the treasury of $14.5 million. Compared to 1993, cash dividends per share increased 27.3% over the three-year period ended September 30, 1996. Cash dividends paid on Class A and Class B common stock were 35 cents per share in 1996, 31 cents per share in 1995 and 27.5 cents per share in 1994. The company anticipates that cash flows from operations and available credit will be sufficient to fund operational requirements in future years. During 1997, the company expects that cash will continue to be used for acquisitions, capital expenditures, new product development, market expansion, retirement of debt and dividend payments. The company may also purchase shares of its common stock depending on market conditions. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of", requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles of an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company is required to comply with SFAS No. 121 in fiscal year 1997 and estimates that its adoption will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", requires either the adoption of a fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation or pro f  orma disclosures as if the fair value method was adopted. The company will implement SFAS No. 123 in fiscal year 1997 by providing the required pro forma disclosures. SFAS No. 125, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities", requires an entity, after a transfer of financial assets, to recognize the assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred, and to write-off assets when control has been surrendered and remove liabilities when obligations have been extinguished. The company is required to comply with SFAS No. 125 in fiscal year 1997 and estimates that its adoption will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. INFLATION The company was not significantly affected by inflation during the past three years. Management continuously attempts to resist cost increases and counteract the effects of inflation through productivity improvements, cost reduction programs and price increases within the constraints of the highly competitive markets in which the company operates.
