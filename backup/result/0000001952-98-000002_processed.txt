[X] As of March 23, 1998, 405,484 common shares were outstanding and the aggregate market value of the voting stock (based upon the average bid and asked prices on March 23, 1998) held by nonaffiliates was approximately $7,720,469. Documents Incorporated by Reference NONE PART I Item 1. Business Irex Corporation ("The Company") consists of two business units. The distribution unit is primarily a distributor and fabricator of mechanical insulation, architectural/acoustical products, and specialty products. The companies in the specialty contracting unit primarily engage in mechanical insulation, abatement, fire protection and interior finish contracting. Domestic operations are conducted through four wholly owned subsidiaries: ACandS, Inc.; Specialty Products and Insulation Co.; CENTIN Corporation; and Spacecon, Inc. Commercial Interior Builders, Inc. has been inactive since December 31, 1992 and was merged into ACandS, Inc., with ACandS surviving the merger, effective as of the close of business on September 30, 1996. Through ACandS Contracting Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of ACandS, Inc., the Company is engaged in thermal insulation contracting in Canada. In 1997, 54% of total revenues were derived from the distribution unit and 46% were the result of specialty contracting operations. These percentages are reflective of a trend over the past several years, wherein distribution has been a growing part of the Company's business. Substantially all of the Company's insulation contracts are made with private contractors, subcontractors and other builders, and such contracts are normally awarded on the basis of competitive bids. Insulation contracting, as part of the general construction business, has been and continues to be highly competitive. The Company is one of the largest in its field, however, and over the years has maintained good customer relationships, with a significant percentage of its sales attributable to contracts with customers for whom the Company has previously done work. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had an unbilled contract backlog of $40.5 million as compared to an unbilled contract backlog of $47.6 million on December 31, 1996. A substantial portion of this backlog can reasonably be expected to be installed during 1998, since the average life cycle of the Company's projects is less than a year. During the past five years, beginning backlog ranged from 30% to 40% of contract revenues during the ensuing year. The Company purchases its materials from a number of sources and is not dependent upon any one supplier for any substantial portion of its requirements. Insulation materials are in plentiful supply and no critical shortages are expected. The Company owns or holds no significant patents, licenses, franchises or other concessions. No significant expenditures are made for new product development, since most materials are purchased directly from manufacturers for installation by the Company on projects where the owner or his representatives specify the products to be applied. Federal, state and local regulations enacted to protect the environment have not had any material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Item 2. Properties The Company owns five properties in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. One is used as the Company's general offices, a two-story brick building containing 21,000 square feet of space. A second is primarily used for general office parking. The third consists mainly of a 29,000 square foot warehouse and shop facility which is used by the Company's subsidiary, Specialty Products and Insulation Co. The fourth, a one-story brick building containing 3,500 square feet of space, is used primarily as headquarters of Specialty Products and Insulation Co. The fifth, a two and one-half story brick building containing 2,500 square feet of space, is predominantly rented to a third party. All of the remaining offices, warehouses and fabricating shops of the Company are leased at various locations throughout the United States and Canada. Some regional and area offices share facilities at the same location, and most of the distribution offices are divided into both warehouse and office space. A few have fabricating shops connected with the warehouse. There are 89 leased regional, area and branch offices in the United States and two offices in Canada. The Company also owns construction tools, light trucks, fabricating machinery, and such related equipment as required by its undertakings, all of which are considered to be in good working order and none of which is subject to any major encumbrances. Most of the automotive fleet has been converted to an operating lease arrangement with lease terms of up to five years. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company's ACandS, Inc. subsidiary is one of a number of defendants in pending lawsuits filed by approximately 103,000 individual claimants seeking damages for injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos fibers in insulation products used at one time by ACandS in its business. ACandS has defenses to these actions, including defenses based on the fact it is primarily a contracting company in the business of installing products manufactured by others. During 1997, ACandS was served with cases involving 31,489 individual plaintiffs. In 1996, ACandS was served with cases involving approximately 37,777 individual plaintiffs. There were 44,904 new plaintiffs in 1995; 18,122 new plaintiffs in 1994; and 20,542 new plaintiffs in 1993. The great majority of the filings in 1995, 1996 and 1997 appear to be the direct result of screenings and other mass solicitation efforts. Of the claims filed during the period, approximately two thirds were filed in either Texas, West Virginia or by the Maritime Legal Clinic. Most of the Maritime Legal Clinic filings have been administratively dismissed, West Virginia filings were reduced substantially during the second half of 1996 and 1997 and on May 29, 1997 Texas enacted tort reform legislation designed to limit the filings in Texas by non-Texas plaintiffs. It is the pattern in this litigation for suits to be filed as the result of mass screenings of individuals employed at a particular facility, through a particular union local, or by a particular employer. It is ACandS's experience that such suits are often filed with little investigation as to whether the claimant ever had any causative exposure to asbestos-containing products associated with the various named defendants. Because of this pattern, historically, about half of the cases filed against ACandS have been closed without payment. As the scope of the mass screening programs has increased, the degree of illness of the claimants has appeared to diminish. The defense of the cases pending against ACandS is now being handled by the Travelers Property Casualty Corp. with the participation of other insurers that wrote coverage for ACandS. Virtually all of ACandS's liability and defense costs for these cases are being paid by ACandS's insurance carriers. Since the beginning of 1981, approximately 155,000 individual claims against ACandS have been settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. Although payments in individual cases have varied considerably, ACandS's percentage of the aggregate liability payments for those cases has been small. As a result, ACandS's average resolution cost for closed cases is very low. The resolution cost per closed case in recent years has been consistent with longterm averages. Bankruptcy filings by a number of companies which had been significant defendants in asbestos cases have not significantly increased the cost of resolving cases. On July 29, 1991, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered that all asbestos-related bodily injury cases pending in the Federal trial courts and not then in trial should be transferred to Judge Charles R. Weiner in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. These proceedings involved less than one-fourth of the cases then pending against ACandS. Subsequently, on January 15, 1993, certain plaintiffs' counsel and a group of 20 asbestos litigation defendants filed a class action complaint and settlement agreement involving all previously unasserted claims by individuals who have been occupationally exposed to asbestos fibers, which was assigned to Judge Weiner as related to the Multidistrict Litigation proceedings. On June 25, 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed dismissal of the class action and settlement, finding that the case did not meet the requirements of the rules permitting class actions. Although the large number of pending cases, the continued efforts of certain courts to clear dockets through consolidated proceedings, the bankruptcy filings by defendants, efforts toward national solutions, and the transfer of federal cases to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania render prediction uncertain, ACandS expects that its percentage of liability payments will continue to be relatively small. ACandS has secured the commitment through final settlement agreements of most of the very substantial insurance coverage applicable to its asbestos-related bodily injury claims. ACandS believes it will secure additional coverage, if needed, from those insurers which have not to date settled with ACandS. Two insurers which wrote significant applicable coverage for ACandS have encountered financial difficulties in recent years, in part because of asbestos and environmental liabilities, but ACandS does not believe these difficulties will affect the adequacy of the coverage available to it. Given the number of currently pending cases and the rate of new filings, it is anticipated that the aggregate amount to be paid by all defendants for asbestos-related bodily injury claims will be very large. Nevertheless, as noted, ACandS's percentage of aggregate liability payments is expected to remain small. Management, therefore, believes that ACandS's insurance coverage is adequate to ensure that these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the long-term business or financial position of the Company. ACandS is also one of a number of defendants in six actions by the owners of schools and other buildings seeking to recover costs associated with the replacement or treatment of installed asbestos-containing products. These cases involve school buildings, public buildings, and office buildings. One of the cases is an alleged class action. ACandS has substantial defenses to the actions, including defenses based upon the character of its operations and the fact that ACandS did not manufacture the asbestos-containing products involved. Moreover, ACandS potentially has indemnification and/or contribution claims against the product manufacturers. To date, ACandS has been dismissed from 102 cases, largely on the basis it had no connection with the products at issue in the claimants' buildings, and has agreed to settle 15 claims. The aggregate amount paid has been very small in the context of this litigation. ACandS was not served with any new building-related cases in 1995, 1996 or 1997. Since 1990, only three new building-related cases have been served on ACandS. The Travelers Property Casualty Corp. is currently providing ACandS with a defense in these building cases, as well as paying settlements when necessary. Coverage based on policies of the Travelers Insurance Companies is furnished pursuant to a settlement agreement, but coverage based on policies of Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. (now part of Travelers) is subject to asserted reservations of rights to later contest both the availability and the amount of coverage. Required payments, nevertheless, continue to be made on the Aetna policies. Decisions in litigation involving insurance coverage available for other defendants in asbestos building cases have thus far varied widely. The appellate rulings which have fully considered coverage issues for asbestos building claims to date provide significant coverage for policyholders. The decisions are consistent with ACandS's view that the trend in the courts is to provide broad coverage for asbestos building cases. Although the availability of coverage for existing and future suits is not resolved, and the aggregate potential loss from these suits may be significant, management believes that ACandS's defenses, potential indemnification and/or contribution rights and insurance coverage are adequate to ensure that these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the long-term business or financial position of the Company. On August 27, 1997, the U.S. Occupational, Safety and Health Administration issued a Citation and Notification of Penalty to Centin Corporation proposing a fine of $307,350 for alleged regulatory violations involving asbestos abatement work at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. The Assistant U.S. Attorney for Dayton, Ohio has also advised Centin of an intention to pursue sanctions in connection with alleged violations of environmental law on this project. Centin had previously disciplined employees for breach of company policy involving this work. Centin believes, however, that the violations as alleged are either incorrect or substantially overstated. Centin has filed a Notice of Contest to the OSHA citation. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are also parties as both plaintiff and defendant to various claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, including claims concerning work performed under various contracts. In the opinion of management, the outcome of the alleged Wright Patterson Air Force Base violations, as well as claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, will not materially affect the Company's long-term business, financial position or results of operations. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters The Company's Common Stock is traded in limited over-the-counter transactions. The number of shares of Common Stock available for trading has been small relative to the total number of shares outstanding, and the trading is sporadic. Price quotations are only binding for a limited number of shares. The following table sets forth the high and low bid prices per share and the dividends per share for the periods indicated. Price quotations have been obtained from Nation  al Quotation Bureau, Inc. High Bid Low Bid 1996 1st Quarter 21 20 2nd Quarter 20 - 1/8 20 3rd Quarter 20 - 1/4 20 4th Quarter 20 - 3/4 20 - 1/4 1997 1st Quarter 22 - 1/4 20 - 3/4 2nd Quarter 25 - 1/4 22 3rd Quarter 26 - 3/4 25 4th Quarter 27 - 1/2 26 - 3/4 On March 23, 1998, the stock price quotation according to National Quotation Bureau, Inc. was 31.25 bid and none offered, and there were 316 record holders of the Company's Common Stock. The total number of shares outstanding is 405,484. The Company has not paid a cash dividend on its Common Stock during the two-year period ended December 31, 1997. In the foreseeable future, the Company does not expect to pay cash dividends on the outstanding common shares at December 31, 1997. Item 6.

(3) See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (4) See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Company reported net income of $2,533,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997, an 11.8% decrease from the $2,873,000 reported for the year ended December 31, 1996. Net income for the year ended December 31, 1995 was $1,778,000. Included in the results for 1995 is the cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of income taxes, of $1,377,000 due to the change in method of estimating the liability for workers' compensation claims. Net income applicable to common shareholders after preferred dividends was $1,553,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to $1,893,000 and $798,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Net income per common share was $4.05 for the year ended December 31, 1997. While this result was $0.75 per common share below the $4.80 achieved for the year ended December 31, 1996, it more than doubled the $2.01 per common share for the year ended December 31, 1995. The loss per common share before cumulative effect of the accounting change was $(1.46) and the cumulative effect of the accounting change was $3.47 per common share for the year ended December 31, 1995. Return on average common shareholders' equity, calculated on net income applicable to common stock, was 12.8%, 18.1% and 8.1% for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company's return on average assets, calculated on net income, was 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 1997, as compared to 3.4% and 2.2% for years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The return on average equity and return on average assets before the cumulative effect of the accounting change in 1995 were (5.9%) and 0.5%, respectively. The Company's distribution subsidiary achieved double- digit growth in revenues and operating income for the fifth consecutive year. Three acquisitions completed during the last quarter of 1997 (see Note 3 to the accompanying financial statements) have positioned the distribution subsidiary to continue its record of positive contributions to the Company's operating results. On the whole, the Company's contracting operations have been squeezed by intense regional competition, where pricing pressures have negatively impacted revenue and earnings performance. In 1997, the principal contracting subsidiaries moved forward in the transition begun during the second half of 1996. The focus has been on creating an operating structure that will provide the most cost-effective and responsive services to customers. The Company's smallest subsidiary, whose specialty is interior finish contracting, saw 1997 revenues increase by 35% over the prior year accompanied by strong earnings performance for the second consecutive year. On January 19, 1998, the Company announced its intention to spin off its distribution subsidiary, Specialty Products and Insulation Company (SPI). Following the transaction, the Company will continue as a parent company, providing administrative services to its three specialty contracting companies. SPI will continue as a specialty product distribution/fabrication company primarily serving the construction industry. See Note 17 to the accompanying financial statements for more information on the spin-off transaction. The following discussion and analysis of results of operations provides additional information on the Company's businesses and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Results of Operations The Company and its subsidiaries operate within the specialty contracting industry (Contracting) and the distribution of products related to that industry (Distribution). Total revenues of $278.2 million in 1997 represented a slight increase from the prior year's total revenue of $271.1 million and were 13.8% ahead of the 1995 revenues of $244.4 million. For the first time in the Company's history, distribution revenues accounted for more than 50% of total revenues. Distribution revenues accounted for 53.8%, 48.3% and 45.1% of total revenues in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Although still strong, the rate of growth for distribution revenues slowed to 14.2% in 1997, as compared to 18.9% in 1996. Distribution revenues were $149.7 million, $131.1 million and $110.2 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Export activity now comprises more than 10% of distribution revenues. Export sales totaled $16.0 million in 1997 compared to $11.0 million in 1996 and $2.0 million in 1995. Five distribution facilities opened between May 1996 and January 1997 were responsible for approximately $7.0 million of the $18.6 million increase in distribution revenues reported for 1997. Two acquisitions, completed toward the end of the year as previously noted, added $1.1 million to 1997 revenues. Contracting revenues declined to their lowest level since 1985. Contracting revenues of $128.4 million in 1997 were 8.4% below the $140.1 million reported for 1996 and also fell $5.8 million short of the $134.2 million recorded in 1995. In addition to the competitive pressures discussed earlier, deregulation in the power generation industry has caused a decline in contracting revenues from this industry. For the three-year period ended December 31, 1997, such revenues have comprised approximately 25% of total contracting revenues. The Company has refocused attention on business development and marketing efforts, recognizing that a broader customer base is needed to stabilize recent trends in revenue erosion. Gross profit of $60.4 million in 1997 was virtually unchanged from the $60.3 million earned during 1996, and it remained a substantial improvement compared to the $52.8 million gross profit generated in 1995. Distribution gross profit was $32.6 million, representing a 10.9 % increase over the $29.4 million achieved in 1996 and a 29.9% increase over the $25.1 million reported for 1995. Revenue growth continues to drive the upward trend in gross profit as distribution margins, gross profit dollars expressed as a percentage of revenues, have actually decreased by one percentage point during the three- year period ended December 31, 1997. Gross profit from contracting slid to $27.7 million in 1997, returning to the level of two years ago, after rebounding to $30.8 million in 1996. Since contracting margins in 1997 were down only slightly compared to 1996, the decrease in gross profit is mostly attributable to a decrease in revenues during this period Although the contracting operations reported similar gross profit in both 1997 and 1995, margins were actually a full percentage point better in 1997. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by less than 1% to $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. SG&A expenses were $53.5 million and $50.0 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively. SG&A expenses within the distribution business, before allocation of parent administrative costs, grew by $1.6 million in 1997 compared to 1996, and this increase is primarily attributable to the opening of five distribution facilities and two acquisitions noted earlier. The distribution business experienced a $2.7 million increase in SG&A expenses during 1996 as compared to 1995, which reflects the growth trend and expansion of operations. Full-time salaried employees within the distribution business increased by 13 and 12, respectively, during 1997 and 1996. SG&A expenses within the contracting businesses, before allocation of parent administrative costs, decreased by $1.3 million in 1997 as compared to the prior year. The restructuring (further described in Note 15 to the accompanying financial statements) undertaken during 1996 by ACandS, Inc., the Company's principal contracting subsidiary, resulted in a $2.2 million reduction to SG&A expenses in 1997. This decrease was offset by a $0.9 million increase in the remaining contracting businesses. Full-time salaried employees within the contracting businesses decreased by 29 and 43, respectively, during 1997 and 1996 as these operations have aligned costs with a shrinking revenue base. The Company's total of salaried employees at December 31, 1997 was 422 as compared to 436 and 465 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Consistent during the three-year period ended December 31, 1997, personnel expenses accounted for approximately 60% of total SG&A expenses. Operating income dipped slightly to $6.4 million in 1997 from the $6.8 million earned in 1996 but was still $3.7 million above the $2.7 million reported for 1995. Operating income expressed as a percentage of revenues was 2.3%, 2.5% and 1.1% for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Finance and Liquidity The Company's working capital position has remained relatively strong despite weak earnings performance from the contracting operations and the requirements for continued expansion of the distribution business. Working capital was $32.3 million at December 31, 1997 as compared to $34.1 million at December 31, 1996. The increase in accounts receivable is mostly attributable to the growth in total revenues of the Company. Turnover of accounts receivable within the distribution operations improved to 5.7 in 1997, up from 5.5 a year ago. However, turnover of accounts receivable in the contracting businesses fell from 4.7 to 4.3 during the same period. The $2.0 million increase in inventories in 1997 compared to 1996 is primarily the result of acquisitions and new distribution facilities as turnover of inventories was relatively unchanged during the period. Contract backlog was $40.5 million at December 31, 1997. This level is significantly below the $47.6 million and $51.9 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, Capital expenditures of $1.2 million in 1997 were comparable to the $1.2 million in 1996 and $1.0 million in 1995. Management does not foresee any significant capital expenditures in the near term other than the normal replacement of equipment. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 1997 was $27.6 million compared to $24.7 million at December 31, 1996. Available short-term lines of credit as of December 31, 1997 were $26.3 million, of which $18.2 million was in use. Short-term debt was used to provide funding of $3.5 million for the acquisitions made during 1997. Credit lines available continue to provide adequate flexibility for operations. See Note 11 to the accompanying financial statements for more information on the Company's borrowings. Preferred Stock Issuance and Dividends During 1992, the Company exchanged 349,864 shares of redeemable preferred stock for an equal number of the Company's outstanding common shares. No shares were redeemed during 1997, and 349,673 preferred shares remain outstanding at December 31, 1997. The common shares exchanged were included in Treasury Stock at December 31, 1997. See Note 13 to the accompanying financial statements for more information on the Company's redeemable preferred stock. Dividends on the preferred stock accrue at an annual rate of $2.80 per share. In the foreseeable future, the Company does not expect to pay cash dividends on the outstanding common shares at December 31, 1997. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 43.7% in 1997 compared to 41.6% in 1996 and 51.8% in 1995. The Company's effective tax rate is primarily dependent upon the amount of operating income and its effect on the rate attributable to the 50% disallowance for meals and entertainment, the impact of state rates on deferred tax assets and the sources of state taxable income. Net deferred income tax assets were $7.6 million at December 31, 1997 compared to $8.2 million at December 31, 1996. The Company has determined that no valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset is required as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, as the future realization of such tax benefits is considered to be more likely than not through the combination of carryback availability, certain tax-planning strategies that would allow for acceleration of deductible temporary differences to utilize remaining carryback availability and through expected future taxable income. Future taxable income must be approximately $11.8 million in order to realize the portion of deferred tax assets not realizable through carryback availability or tax-planning strategies. Year 2000 Issue The Company's ability to conduct its day-to-day operations is dependent in part on an integrated software program and data-based system (collectively, the System). The System serves as a critical tool in carrying out functions in several key areas of the business, including inventory management, contract management, pricing, sales, financial reporting and personnel administration. The Company has assessed the System and determined that modifications are required to properly utilize dates beyond December 31, 1999. The Company had already committed to upgrade the System in order to renew the vendor maintenance agreement (under which the Company receives technical support), and believes the upgrade will substantially resolve Year 2000 issues in the System. The Company will utilize both internal and external resources to replace, reprogram and test software for Year 2000 compliance and plans to complete the conversion prior to December 31, 1998. These costs arising through the normal course of business will be expensed as incurred. In relation to hardware within the System (primarily desktop computers networked to a central location  ), management does not have an estimate of the cost to replace these items. The Company does not currently have any information concerning Year 2000 compliance status of its suppliers and customers. In the event that any of the Company's significant suppliers or customers does not successfully and timely achieve Year 2000 compliance, the Company's business or operations could be adversely affected.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Shareholders and Board of Directors, Irex Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Irex Corporation (a Pennsylvania corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. These financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Irex Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 1995, the Company changed its method of accounting for the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims. Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index of financial statements is for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This schedule has been subject to the auditing procedures applies in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

IREX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995 1. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES: The following summarizes the significant accounting policies employed by Irex Corporation (the Company) and subsidiaries. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Irex Corporation and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain 1996 items h  ave been reclassified to conform with 1997 presentation. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation," gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions during the year are included in operating results, while gains and losses resulting from translation of the financial statements of the Company's Canadian subsidiary at the end of the year are reflected as cumulative translation adjustments in shareholders' investment. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses in 1997, 1996 and 1995 were not material. Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Methods of Accounting for Revenues Revenues from lump-sum basis construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract. This method is used because management considers this to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Revenues from time and material contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned. Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and contract settlements, result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Distribution and other revenues consist primarily of outright sales of purchased insulation and acoustical products. Reserves for Certain Self- Insured Business Risks The Company is self-insured against a portion of its workers' compensation and other insurance risks. The process of determining reserve requirements for losses within its self-insured retention limits utilizes historical trends, involves an evaluation of claim frequency, severity and other factors and also includes the effect of future inflation. Effective January 1, 1995, the Company changed its method of measuring the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims. The new method employs actuarial assumptions to discount to present value the estimated future payments for these claims, using a risk-free interest rate. The Company believes this method is preferable because it more accurately reflects the current impact on its financial condition of the future cash outflows. The cumulative effect of this accounting change was $1,377,000 ($2,276,000 less the related tax effect of $899,000) and was included in net income for the year ended December 31, 1995. The impact of this change, exclusive of the cumulative effect, on operating results during 1997, 1996 and 1995 was not significant nor is it expected to have a significant impact on future results of operations. At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the estimated undiscounted liability for workers' compensation claims was $9,346,000 and $11,943,000, respectively. The present value of such claims was $7,695,000 and $9,487,000, using a weighted average discount rate of 6.66% and 6.80%, respectively. The expected future payments as of December 31, 1997, on an undiscounted basis, are as follows: 1998 $2,632,000 1999 1,639,000 2000 1,082,000 2001 812,000 2002 604,000 2003 and thereafter 2,577,000 $ 9,346,000 Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of the Company's Canadian subsidiary since taxes payable upon distribution, net of foreign tax credits, are not expected to be significant. At December 31, 1997, the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings was $1,265,000. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are depreciated using principally the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Classification Estimated Useful Lives Buildings 15 to 30 years Leasehold improvements 3 to 10 years Machinery and equipment 3 to 7 years Other Assets Other assets primarily consist of goodwill. Goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses, is being amortized on a straight-line basis principally over 15 years. The Company develops operating income projections and evaluates the recoverability and amortization period of goodwill using these projections. Based upon management's current assessment, the estimated remaining amortization period of goodwill is appropriate and the remaining balance is fully recoverable. Goodwill amortization did not have a material effect on the operating results for the year ended December 31, 1997. Non-Current Liabilities Other long-term liabilities consist of the non-current portions of workers' compensation, insurance, pension and postretirement benefit liabilities. Concentration of Business The Company and its subsidiaries operate within the specialty contracting industry and the distribution of products related to that industry. For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues. The Company's contracting and distribution businesses purchase materials for use in contracts or resale from a limited number of major suppliers. Such concentration is normal for the industry and does not present an unreasonable risk or vulnerability to the Company. Based on completed contracts, approximately 25% of contracting revenues were derived from the power generation industry during the three-year period ended December 31, 1997. Management believes this concentration does not represent an unusual risk as contracts are widely dispersed by geography and customer. CONTRACTS IN PROCESS: Contracts in process as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 are comprised of the following elements: 1997 1996 Costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts $ 87,161,000 $ 94,950,000 Less: Billings on uncompleted contracts (85,537,000) (92,606,000) Net $ 1,624,000 $ 2,344,000 Contracts in process as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 are reflected in the accompanying balance sheets under the following captions: 1997 1996 Actual costs and estimated earnings on contracts in process in excess of billings $ 4,421,000 $ 5,130,000 Billings in excess of actual costs and estimated earnings on contracts in process (2,797,000) (2,786,000) $ 1,624,000 $ 2,344,000 Actual costs incurred on contracts in process in excess of billings includes contract costs attributable to claims in the amount of $75,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1996. Contract costs related to claims are carried at the lower of actual costs incurred or estimated net realizable value. 3. ACQUISITIONS: The Company completed three acquisitions during 1997 for cash consideration of approximately $3,453,000. The acquisitions included the stock of one company and certain assets of two additional companies, all of which are primarily engaged in the distribution business. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the financial statements reflect the results of operations and cash flows of the operations from the dates of acquisitions. Had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, revenues and operating income would not have been materially different from reported results. During 1995, the Company acquired certain assets of four warehouses for cash consideration of approximately $961,000. The assets were acquired from a company primarily engaged in the distribution business. 4. INCOME TAXES: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). Deferred income taxes are computed based on the differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. The impact of changes in tax rates is reflected in income in the period in which the change is enacted. In conformity with SFAS 109, deferred tax assets are classified based on the financial reporting classification of the related liabilities and assets which give rise to temporary book/tax differences. Deferred taxes relate to the following temporary differences: 1997 1996 Insurance reserves $ 6,470,000 $ 6,698,000 Bad debt reserves 305,000 617,000 Uniform cost capitalization on inventories 477,000 473,000 Pension and other benefits 352,000 436,000 Contracts 97,000 261,000 Other (140,000) (301,000) $ 7,561,000 $ 8,184,000 The Company has determined that no valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset is required as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, as the future realization of such tax benefits is considered to be more likely than not through the combination of carryback availability, certain tax planning strategies that would allow for acceleration of deductible temporary differences to utilize remaining carryback availability and through expected future taxable income. Income (loss) before income taxes is comprised of the following components: 1997 1996 1995 Domestic $ 4,390,000 $ 4,809,000 $ 3,505,000 Foreign 108,000 114,000 (397,000) $ 4,498,000 $ 4,923,000 $ 3,108,000 Income tax provision (benefit) consists of: 1997 1996 1995 Currently payable: Federal $ 1,028,000 $ 1,749,000 $ 601,000 State 260,000 130,000 329,000 Foreign 54,000 57,000 (198,000) Total currently payable 1,342,000 1,936,000 732,000 Deferred: Federal 602,000 (67,000) (80,000) State 21,000 181,000 (221,000) Total deferred 623,000 114,000 (301,000) Total $ 1,965,000 $ 2,050,000 $ 431,000 (1) (1) Excludes provision of $899,000 as of January 1, 1995, from the cumulative effect of the change in accounting (see Note 1). The effective income tax rate is different from the statutory Federal income tax rate as indicated below: 1997 1996 1995 Statutory federal income tax rate 34.0% 34.0% 34.0% State income taxes ($281,000, $311,000, and $108,000), net of federal benefit 4.1 4.2 8.6 Meals and entertainment (50% disallowance) 4.5 3.1 17.7 Effects of foreign taxes 0.4 0.4 (7.6) Other, net 0.7 (0.1) (0.9) Effective income tax rate 43.7% 41.6% 51.8% The changes in the effective state income tax rate are due to the impact of state rate changes on deferred tax assets, as well as the changes in the sources of the Company's state taxable income. 5. CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES: The Company's ACandS, Inc. subsidiary is one of a number of defendants in pending lawsuits filed by approximately 103,000 individual claimants seeking damages for injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos fibers in insulation products used at one time by ACandS in its business. ACandS has defenses to these actions, including defenses based on the fact it is primarily a contracting company in the business of installing products manufactured by others. During 1997, ACandS was served with cases involving 31,489 individual plaintiffs. In 1996, ACandS was served with cases involving approximately 37,777 individual plaintiffs. There were 44,904 new plaintiffs in 1995; 18,122 new plaintiffs in 1994; and 20,542 new plaintiffs in 1993. The great majority of the filings in 1995, 1996 and 1997 appear to be the direct result of screenings and other mass solicitation efforts. Of the claims filed during the period, approximately two thirds were filed in either Texas, West Virginia or by the Maritime Legal Clinic. Most of the Maritime Legal Clinic filings have been administratively dismissed, West Virginia filings were reduced substantially during the second half of 1996 and 1997 and on May 29, 1997 Texas enacted tort reform legislation designed to limit the filings in Texas by non-Texas plaintiffs. It is the pattern in this litigation for suits to be filed as the result of mass screenings of individuals employed at a particular facility, through a particular union local, or by a particular employer. It is ACandS's experience that such suits are often filed with little investigation as to whether the claimant ever had any causative exposure to asbestos-containing products associated with the various named defendants. Because of this pattern, historically, about half of the cases filed against ACandS have been closed without payment. As the scope of the mass screening programs has increased, the degree of illness of the claimants has appeared to diminish. The defense of the cases pending against ACandS is now being handled by the Travelers Property Casualty Corp. with the participation of other insurers that wrote coverage for ACandS. Virtually all of ACandS's liability and defense costs for these cases are being paid by ACandS's insurance carriers. Since the beginning of 1981, approximately 155,000 individual claims against ACandS have been settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. Although payments in individual cases have varied considerably, ACandS's percentage of the aggregate liability payments for those cases has been small. As a result, ACandS's average resolution cost for closed cases is very low. The resolution cost per closed case in recent years has been consistent with long-term averages. Bankruptcy filings by a number of companies which had been significant defendants in asbestos cases have not significantly increased the cost of resolving cases. On July 29, 1991, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered that all asbestos-related bodily injury cases pending in the Federal trial courts and not then in trial should be transferred to Judge Charles R. Weiner in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. These proceedings involved less than one-fourth of the cases then pending against ACandS. Subsequently, on January 15, 1993, certain plaintiffs' counsel and a group of 20 asbestos litigation defendants filed a class action complaint and settlement agreement involving all previously unasserted claims by individuals who have been occupationally exposed to asbestos fibers, which was assigned to Judge Weiner as related to the Multidistrict Litigation proceedings. On June 25, 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed dismissal of the class a  ction and settlement, finding that the case did not meet the requirements of the rules permitting class actions. Although the large number of pending cases, the continued efforts of certain courts to clear dockets through consolidated proceedings, the bankruptcy filings by defendants, efforts toward national solutions, and the transfer of federal cases to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania render prediction uncertain, ACandS expects that its percentage of liability payments will continue to be relatively small. ACandS has secured the commitment through final settlement agreements of most of the very substantial insurance coverage applicable to its asbestos-related bodily injury claims. ACandS believes it will secure additional coverage, if needed, from those insurers which have not to date settled with ACandS. Two insurers which wrote significant applicable coverage for ACandS have encountered financial difficulties in recent years, in part because of asbestos and environmental liabilities, but ACandS does not believe these difficulties will affect the adequacy of the coverage available to it. Given the number of currently pending cases and the rate of new filings, it is anticipated that the aggregate amount to be paid by all defendants for asbestos-related bodily injury claims will be very large. Nevertheless, as noted, ACandS's percentage of aggregate liability payments is expected to remain small. Management, therefore, believes that ACandS's insurance coverage is adequate to ensure that these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the long-term business or financial position of the Company. ACandS is also one of a number of defendants in six actions by the owners of schools and other buildings seeking to recover costs associated with the replacement or treatment of installed asbestos-containing products. These cases involve school buildings, public buildings, and office buildings. One of the cases is an alleged class action. ACandS has substantial defenses to the actions, including defenses based upon the character of its operations and the fact that ACandS did not manufacture the asbestos-containing products involved. Moreover, ACandS potentially has indemnification and/or contribution claims against the product manufacturers. To date, ACandS has been dismissed from 102 cases, largely on the basis it had no connection with the products at issue in the claimants' buildings, and has agreed to settle 15 claims. The aggregate amount paid has been very small in the context of this litigation. ACandS was not served with any new building-related cases in 1995, 1996 or 1997. Since 1990, only three new building-related cases have been served on ACandS. The Travelers Property Casualty Corp. is currently providing ACandS with a defense in these building cases, as well as paying settlements when necessary. Coverage based on policies of the Travelers Insurance Companies is furnished pursuant to a settlement agreement, but coverage based on policies of Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. (now part of Travelers) is subject to asserted reservations of rights to later contest both the availability and the amount of coverage. Required payments, nevertheless, continue to be made on the Aetna policies. Decisions in litigation involving insurance coverage available for other defendants in asbestos building cases have thus far varied widely. The appellate rulings which have fully considered coverage issues for asbestos building claims to date provide significant coverage for policyholders. The decisions are consistent with ACandS's view that the trend in the courts is to provide broad coverage for asbestos building cases. Although the availability of coverage for existing and future suits is not resolved, and the aggregate potential loss from these suits may be significant, management believes that ACandS's defenses, potential indemnification and/or contribution rights and insurance coverage are adequate to ensure that these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the long-term business or financial position of the Company. On August 27, 1997, the U.S. Occupational, Safety and Health Administration issued a Citation and Notification of Penalty to Centin Corporation proposing a fine of $307,350 for alleged regulatory violations involving asbestos abatement work at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. The Assistant U.S. Attorney for Dayton, Ohio has also advised Centin of an intention to pursue sanctions in connection with alleged violations of environmental law on this project. Centin had previously disciplined employees for breach of company policy involving this work. Centin believes, however, that the violations as alleged are either incorrect or substantially overstated. Centin has filed a Notice of Contest to the OSHA citation. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are also parties as both plaintiff and defendant to various claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, including claims concerning work performed under various contracts. In the opinion of management, the outcome of the alleged Wright Patterson Air Force Base violations, as well as claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, will not materially affect the Company's long-term business, financial position or results of operations. 6. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash balances in 1997, 1996 and 1995 was not material. The Company's income tax and interest payments are summarized below: 1997 1996 1995 Income taxes (net of refunds) $ 1,708,000 $ 1,548,000 $ 1,010,000 Interest $ 2,005,000 $ 2,054,000 $ 2,034,000 7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS: Defined Benefit Pension Plan The Company and its subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of their salaried employees. The benefits under the plan are based on years of service and salary levels. The Company's policy is to fund pension costs in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Actuarially computed net pension expense includes the following components: 1997 1996 1995 Service cost-benefits earned during the period $ 517,000 $ 608,000 $ 480,000 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 551,000 524,000 439,000 Return on plan assets: Actual (1,569,000) (1,042,000) (1,147,000) Deferred 938,000 510,000 805,000 Recognized return (631,000) (532,000) (342,000) Net amortization (41,000) 10,000 (5,000) Net pension expense $ 396,000 $ 610,000 $ 572,000 The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1997 and 1996: 1997 1996 Actuarial present value of benefit obligations: Accumulated benefit obligation, including vested benefits of $6,629,000 and $5,568,000, respectively $ 6,986,000 $ 6,039,000 Projected benefit obligation for service rendered to date $ 8,760,000 $ 7,698,000 Plan assets at fair value (8,759,000) (7,528,000) Projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets 1,000 170,000 Unrecognized net gain from past experience different from that assumed and effects of changes in assumptions 840,000 275,000 Accrued pension cost $ 841,000 $ 445,000 Assumptions used in the accounting were: 1997 1996 Weighted average discount rates 7.25% 7.75% Rates of increase in future compensation levels 5.00% 5.00% Expected long-term rate of return on assets 8.50% 8.50% A substantial number of the hourly employees of the Company's subsidiaries are covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained, multiemployer pension plans. The Company contributed approximately $5,297,000 in 1997, $6,146,000 in 1996, and $5,791,000 in 1995 to such plans. Information is not available from the plans' administrators to permit the Company to determine its share of the unfunded vested benefits of these plans. Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company and its subsidiaries provide certain health care benefits under company-sponsored plans for the majority of retired salaried employees. Active salaried employees who were at least age 55 and had 10 years of consecutive service at January 1, 1990 are eligible for these benefits upon retirement. Also, active salaried employees of the Company whose age plus years of service equaled at least 55 at January 1, 1990 are eligible for these benefits upon retirement when they attain age 62 as long as such employees have either 20 years of service or their age plus years of service equals 90 upon retirement. Cash payments of up to $60.00 per month are given to retirees over age 65 to purchase supplemental Medicare coverage. Eligible retirees under age 65 are fully covered by the Company's insurance plan. The number of retirees under age 65 currently participating in the plan is not significant. The expected cost of these benefits is charged to expense during the years that the employees render service. The transition obligation is being amortized over 20 years. Actuarially computed net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following components: 1997 1996 Service cost- benefits earned during the period $ 6,000 $ 8,000 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 68,000 71,000 Expected return on plan assets --- (9,000) Amortization of transition obligation 48,000 48,000 Amortization of net gain (30,000) (28,000) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost $ 92,000 $ 90,000 The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1997 and 1996: 1997 1996 Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation: Vested benefit obligation $ 798,000 $ 798,000 Non-vested benefit obligation 129,000 158,000 927,000 956,000 Plan assets at fair value --- (51,000) Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation in excess of plan assets 927,000 905,000 Unrecognized transition obligation (721,000) (769,000) Unrecognized net gain 289,000 340,000 Accrued postretirement benefit liability $ 495,000 $ 476,000 For measurement purposes, a 13% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for calendar 1997; the rate was assumed to decrease to 10% in 1998 and 7% for 2001 and remain level thereafter. Due to the provisions of the plan, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would not have a significant impact on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1997. The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.25% and 7.75% at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 8.50% for 1996. Other The Company and its subsidiaries have incentive compensation plans covering substantially all of their officers and key employees. Incentive compensation for 1997 was determined according to a separate measurement basis for the Company and each of its subsidiaries. Rate of return on assets, earnings before interest and taxes, and after-tax earnings in excess of the cost of capital each served as the basis in one of the various incentive plans. For 1996 and 1995, the amount of incentive compensation was primarily dependent upon the rate of return on assets of the Company's subsidiaries and their particular district or branch offices and the net income of the Company. Total incentive compensation expense was $2,337,000 for 1997, $2,621,000 for 1996, and $1,698,000 for 1995. The Company and its subsidiaries also maintain defined contribution savings incentive and employee stock ownership (ESOP) plans covering substantially all salaried employees. Contributions to the savings incentive plan are based on specified percentages of employee contributions to the plan, while ESOP contributions are discretionary. Expense for these plans was $616,000 in 1997, $830,000 in 1996, and $665,000 in 1995. 8. STOCK OPTION PLANS: The Company maintains two non- qualified stock option plans providing for the issuance to key employees and outside directors of up to 80,000 options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. Generally, options outstanding under the Company's stock options plans: (i) are granted at prices which equate to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, (ii) vest over periods of one to three years, and (iii) expire ten years subsequent to date of grant. Following is a summary of the status of the number of stock options as of December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, and the activity during the year ended on those dates, along with the range of exercise prices for options outstanding at year end: 1997 1996 1995 Wgtd.

As provided for in the statement, the Company elected to continue the intrinsic value method of expense recognition. Had compensation cost for the stock option plans been determined using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123, the Company's net income applicable to common stock and net income per common share would approximate the proforma amounts below: 1997 1996 1995 Net Income Applicable to Common Stock As reported $1,553,000 $1,893,000 $ 798,000 Proforma $1,534,000 $1,877,000 $ 795,000 Net Income Per Common Share As reported - Basic $ 4.05 $ 4.80 $ 2.01 As reported - Diluted $ 4.00 $ 4.76  $ 2.00 Proforma - Basic $ 4.00 $ 4.76 $ 2.00 Proforma - Diluted $ 3.95 $ 4.72 $ 1.99 The proforma effect of applying SFAS 123 in this disclosure for 1997, 1996 and 1995 is not necessarily representative of the proforma amounts for future years.

Subsequent to December 31, 1997, employees and directors of the Company exercised a total of 27,100 stock options granted in the years 1990 through 1995. On February 26, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors passed a resolution that all employee stock options granted in 1996 and 1997 and director options granted in 1998 became fully vested immediately. Subsequent to the Board's action, employees and directors of the Company exercised an additional 8,500 stock options which had been granted in 1996, 1997 and 1998. The table below sets forth the year of grant for those options exercised subsequent to December 31, 1997: Year Granted Number Exercised 1990 through 1994 25,600 1995 1,500 1996 3,200 1997 4,300 1998 1,000 9. INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE: In 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128 "Earnings Per Share." SFAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures. The Company's basic income per share is calculated as income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For diluted income per share, income available to common shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the incremental number of shares added as a result of converting common stock equivalents, as calculated using the treasury stock method. The Company's common stock equivalents consist solely of outstanding stock options. As a result, income per share for 1996 and 1995 were restated as a result of the Company's adoption of SFAS No. 128. This adoption had no effect on previously reported income per common share. Average Per-Share Income Shares Amount FOR THE YEAR ENDED 1997 Income per Common Share - Basic Income available to common shareholders $ 1,553,000 383,859 $ 4.05 Options issued to Employees and Directors (Note 8) --- 4,683 Income per Common Share - Diluted Income available to common shareholders $ 1,553,000 388,542 $ 4.00 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 1996 Income per Common Share - Basic Income available to common shareholders $ 1,893,000 394,653 $ 4.80 Options issued to Employees and Directors (Note 8) --- 2,818 Income per Common Share - Diluted Income available to common shareholders $ 1,893,000 397,471 $ 4.76 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 1995 Income (Loss) per Common Share - Basic Income (loss) available to common shareholders before cumulative effect of accounting change $ (579,000) 397,127 $ (1.46) Cumulative effect of accounting change 1,377,000 --- 3.47 Income available to common shareholders $ 798,000 397,127 $ 2.01 Option issued to Directors (Note 8) 1,398 Income (Loss) per Common Share - Diluted Income (loss) available to common shareholders before cumulative effect of accounting change $ (579,000) 398,525 $ (1.45) Cumulative effect of accounting change 1,377,000 --- 3.45 Income available to common shareholders $ 798,000 398,525 $ 2.00 Options to purchase approximately 20,100 shares of common stock at $31 per share were outstanding during 1997 but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares. The options, which expire 10 years from the date of grant, were still outstanding as of December 31, 1997. 10. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN FINANCING TRANSACTION: In December 1985, the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) purchased on the open market 45,227 shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,000,000. The shares were solicited pursuant to a Schedule 13E-4 Tender Offer Statement. Financing for the purchase was obtained by the ESOP through a ten-year bank loan which bears interest at 9% per annum and was guaranteed by the Company. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this loan was reflected as long-term debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding charge to equity for the purchase price of the related shares, less principal repayments on the bank loan. The loan was repaid during 1995. 11. BORROWINGS: Bank Borrowings The Company had short-term lines of credit totaling $26,300,000 and $23,081,000, of which $18,224,000 and $12,169,000 was in use, as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. These loans bear interest at not more than the prime rate. (The weighted average interest rate was 6.9% as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.) The Company maintains deposits at several banks which serve various corporate purposes including the support of its lines of credit available or in use. All lines of credit are renegotiated annually. Long-Term Debt Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31, 1997 and 1996: 1997 1996 9% unsecured senior notes payable in equal annual installments from May 1, 1996 to 2002 $ 9,286,000 $ 11,143,000 7.3% unsecured term note payable in equal semi-annual installments from May 1, 1996 to November 1, 1997 --- 1,400,000 Other long-term debt 94,000 --- Total 9,380,000 12,543,000 Less current portion 1,876,000 3,257,000 $ 7,504,000 $ 9,286,000 On May 1 and November 1, during the term of the 9% unsecured senior notes, the Company has the option to prepay principal balances in multiples of $100,000 plus accrued interest and a prepayment penalty. The Company's long-term debt agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of debt, investments, dividend payments and the redemption of capital stock and preferred stock. These long-term debt agreements require that the Company maintain certain financial ratios and levels of net worth. At December 31, 1997, the Company was in compliance with all of these covenants. Long-term borrowings maturing during the next five years are as follows: 1998 1,876,000 1999 1,871,000 2000 1,863,000 2001 1,863,000 2002 1,863,000 Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities, the estimated fair market value of long-term debt was $9,543,000 as of December 31, 1997. 12. LEASE COMMITMENTS: The Company leases warehouses, sales offices and computer equipment under noncancelable lease agreements. Rental expense for all operating leases was $5,877,000 in 1997, $5,721,000 in 1996 and $5,654,000 in 1995. As of December 31, 1997, the future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable leases that have terms in excess of one year are as follows: 1998 $ 3,203,000 1999 2,330,000 2000 1,816,000 2001 1,105,000 2002 621,000 Subsequent years 302,000 Total minimum rental obligations $ 9,377,000 13. REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK: During 1992, the Company offered to exchange one share of preferred stock with a par value of $1 per share for each share of the Company's outstanding common stock up to a maximum of 350,000 common shares (the Offer). A total of 349,864 common shares were exchanged in December 1992 in accordance with the Offer. Dividends on the preferred stock accrue at an annual rate of $2.80 per share. Such dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears commencing January 1, 1993. At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had accrued $245,000 for such dividends. In the foreseeable future, the Company does not expect to pay cash dividends on the outstanding common shares at December 31, 1997. The preferred stock is nonvoting except in certain circumstances. On or after February 1, 1998, the Company may, at its option, redeem the preferred stock, in whole or in part, initially at $31.50 per share and declining to $30 per share on and after February 1, 2003, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Prior to February 1, 2013, the Company will not have the right to redeem shares of preferred stock which have been continuously owned beneficially by the holder thereof since the issuance of the preferred stock in connection with the Offer, if such holder elects to prohibit such redemption. On December 1, 1998, and on each December 1 thereafter through and including December 1, 2012, the Company will be obligated to redeem shares of the preferred stock that any holders thereof have requested the Company to redeem at $30 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, subject to an annual limitation on the number of shares that the Company will be obligated to redeem. The preferred stock has a liquidation value of $30 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. The payment of dividends on, and the redemption of, the preferred stock may be restricted by the terms of Company loan agreements or by the terms of future financing arrangements. 14. ACCRUED LIABILITIES: The components of accrued liabilities as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 are as follows: 1997 1996 Salaries and wages $ 2,590,000 $ 2,643,000 General, auto and other liability insurance 5,746,000 4,833,000 Other 4,495,000 4,777,000 $12,831,000 $12,253,000 15. RESTRUCTURING: During 1996, the Company's principal contracting subsidiary, ACandS, Inc., underwent an organizational restructuring. This restructuring involved integrating numerous semi- autonomous branches into three highly integrated regions in the interest of reducing administrative expenses and providing more responsive services to customers. In conjunction with this restructuring, ACandS, Inc. incurred expenses of approximately $500,000, which primarily consisted of severance pay and lease termination costs. Although the restructuring was essentially completed during 1996, approximately $145,000 of expenses are included in 1997 results as reported. 16. NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES: The components of non- current liabilities as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 are as follows: 1997 1996 Workers compensation and other insurance $ 7,820,000 $ 8,087,000 Retirement benefits 824,000 1,040,000 $ 8,644,000 $ 9,127,000 17. SUBSEQUENT EVENT: On January 19, 1998, the Company announced its intention to spin off one of its subsidiaries, Specialty Products and Insulation Company (SPI). The Company's Board of Directors, at its February 26, 1998 meeting, approved the proposed transaction in which shareholders of Irex common stock will receive a dividend of SPI common stock. This dividend is expected to be a tax-free distribution to current shareholders of Irex common stock. The transaction is expected to be completed by the middle of 1998. Following the transaction, Irex will continue as a parent company, providing administrative services to its three specialty contracting companies. SPI will become a separate company, primarily concentrating on specialty product distribution/fabrication in the construction industry. For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, SPI had net revenues of $149,053,000, $129,417,000, and $107,713,000, respectively; gross profit was $34,096,000 in 1997, $31,110,000 in 1996, and $25,892,000 in 1995. Total assets were $47,651,000 and $38,935,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

(2) Includes amounts earned under the Company's Savings Incentive Plan and Employee Stock Ownership. Savings Incentive Plan. The Company offers a Savings Incentive Plan for all salaried employees whereby they can elect to contribute up to 15% of their salary and incentive compensation into accounts in their names which are independently managed and invested. Pursuant to amendments adopted by the Board of Directors which became effective January 1, 1985, the employees' contributions to the Plan were made in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's match is 75% of the first 6% of employee contributions. One-third of the Company's match is invested in Irex Corporation common stock and is subject to the Company achieving a specific financial performance target. On December 31, 1997 there were 315 employees of the Company and its subsidiaries participating in the Savings Incentive Plan and 30,895 shares of common stock held by such Plan. Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Effective January 1, 1983, the Company established an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) and Trust for the benefit of employees, of which W. Kirk Liddell, Ronald L. King, and Jane E. Pinkerton are trustees. All salaried employees of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries automatically become participants in the ESOP on the January 1 following their date of hire. Participants are neither required nor permitted to make contributions to the ESOP. Contributions to the Plan are based upon the Company's achievement of specific financial performance targets. In 1997, a $100,000 contribution was made. On December 31, 1997, there were 320 employees of the Company and its subsidiaries eligible to participate in the ESOP and the total of 36,354 shares of common stock held by the ESOP were fully allocated to such participants' accounts. (3) Mr. Liddell's bonus also included a grant of 620 shares of Irex Corporation stock valued at $13,562. (4) Mr. King is included in his capacity as President of a major wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. (5) Mr. Andrew is included in his capacity as President of a major wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Stock Option Plans On February 28, 1990, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Irex Corporation Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan under which options to purchase not more than 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be granted over the next ten years to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The number of shares available for options was reduced during 1995 from 200,000 shares to 55,000 shares. The recipients of options and the number of options granted to them are determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee, no option may be exercised before three years nor more than ten years after the date of grant. On July 20, 1994, the Board of Directors amended the plan to provide that Fair Market Value on the date of the grant shall be defined as (i) the mean between the highest and lowest prices of actual sales of Shares on the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed on such date, or, (ii) if there are no such sales on such date, the mean between the closing bid and asked prices of the Shares on such exchange on such date, or, (iii) if the Shares are not listed on any national securities exchange, the mean between the closing high bid and low asked prices of the Shares in over-the-counter trading as identified by the National Quotation Bureau or other comparable source selected by the Committee, or (iv) if the Committee determines that the mean is not an accurate reflection of the market value of the Shares, the fair market value as determined for purposes of the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, less a discount reflecting the lack of liquidity of Shares in the open market, or, (v) if the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan has terminated, or has failed to provide a current valuation of the Shares for any other reason, the fair market value as determined by a disinterested third party selected by the Committee and qualified to perform an evaluation of the Shares. Prior to this amendment, the option price was established at the fair market value as determined for purposes of the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, less a discount reflecting the lack of liquidity of shares in the open market. The following table sets forth, for the individuals named, options granted during 1997.

The above table sets forth information as to the aggregate options granted and outstanding as of December 31, 1997, for the individuals named. Retirement Income Plan Table The Company's Retirement Income Plan which became effective September 1, 1984, covers all salaried employees. All costs are paid by the Company, and the amount of retirement income is determined by the career average rate of compensation and length of credited service at retirement. Effective January 1, 1989, the Plan provides for an annual benefit based on 1% of annual compensation up to the Social Security covered compensation level and 1.5% of compensation over that level. The Retirement Income Plan in effect prior to the adoption of this Plan provided for benefits based on the final five years average compensation and length of service at retirement. Assets of the former Plan sufficient to fund all accrued benefits under that Plan for participants were used to purchase annuities for the participants or transferred to the participants' accounts in the Savings Incentive Plan. The following table sets forth required Pension Plan information for the Chief Executive Officer and the four other most highly compensated executive officers.

The Chairman of the Board of the Company receives an additional annual fee of $20,500, $3,000 of which shall be paid in Irex common stock On April 28, 1994, the shareholders approved a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors of the Company. This plan authorized the granting of options on 25,000 shares of Common Stock to directors who are not employees of the Company. Each outside director automatically receives an option to purchase 500 shares as of January 1, 1994 and each January 1 thereafter through and including January 1, 1998. Options are granted at Fair Market Value consistent with the pricing mechanism established under the Non- Qualified Stock Option Plan for employees. Options are exercisable at any time more than one year from the date of grant, but no more than ten years from the date of the grant. Item 12.
