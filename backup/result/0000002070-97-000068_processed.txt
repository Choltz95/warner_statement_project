Portions of the Registrant's definitive proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on October 31, 1997, are incorporated by reference into Part III. PART I ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - ----------------- BUSINESS The Registrant was duly organized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on April 26, 1946, as successor to a business founded in 1917. Its sole line of business is the design and manufacture of power conversion equipment for electronic and electrical systems. Principal markets encompass the computer, test equipment, information systems, military, aerospace and telecommunications and a variety of industrial, commercial and residential fields for applications that require conversion of electrical energy from one useable state to another. Products are distributed to customers through the Registrant's sales force, independent sales representatives and wholesale distributors. The business of the Registrant is not seasonal in nature. COMPETITION Competitive conditions within the power conversion industry are intense. The Registrant competes with many other companies, some of which have far greater resources than the Registrant. The principal methods of competition within the industry are price, service and product performance. To meet this competition, the Registrant attempts to maintain high standards of engineering, manufacturing and customer service. Due to the number and variety of competitors, reliable data relative to the Registrant's competitive position within the power conversion industry would be difficult to develop and is not known nor believed to exist. CUSTOMERS Power conversion equipment sales encompass markets wherein the demands of any one customer may vary greatly due to changes in technology and market strategy. One customer of the Company accounted for 16.2% and 14.8%, respectively, of fiscal 1997 and 1996 sales and 10.0% and 8.2%, respectively, of June 30, 1997 and 1996, accounts receivable. In comparison, two customers accounted for 13.4% and 10.6%, respectively, of fiscal 1995 sales, one of which also accounted for 10.6% of June 30, 1995, accounts receivable. BACKLOG The backlog of orders believed to be firm totaled approximately $16,946,000 at June 30, 1997, compared with approximately $14,912,000 at June 30, 1996. The change in backlog as of June 30, 1997, compared with backlog as of June 30, 1996, reflects increased order volume (due within one year) in the aerospace business related to the fiber nickel cadmium (FNC) battery and charger systems used in military and aerospace applications. Backlog orders at June 30, 1997, are generally expected to be filled during the current fiscal year. RAW MATERIALS The Registrant purchases materials in a semi-finished state from other manufacturers and distributors. Availability of materials is considered adequate to maintain current production levels. PATENTS The Registrant holds several technical patents and trademarks and is a party to certain patent applications. The extent of the effect of such patents and trademarks is, however, in the opinion of management, not material at this time. LICENSES The Registrant is a party to several license agreements. The only material license, providing for the sale and manufacture of a proprietary fiber nickel cadmium battery (FNC), is an agreement with Hoppecke Batterie Systeme GmbH (formerly, Daug-Hoppecke Gesellschaft Fur Batteriesysteme mbH ("DAHO")) of Brilon, Germany. The Company recorded an impairment loss write-off as of June 30, 1994, assigning zero value to the FNC license agreement. EMPLOYEES As of June 30, 1997, approximately 660 persons were employed by the Registrant. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Approximately 7% of the Registrant's employees are engaged in engineering design and product development. New products are continuously designed to satisfy specific customer requirements, and the cost of such development is expensed as incurred. Since satisfaction of many customers' needs requires advancing applicable technology, applied research is an integral part of engineering-design and product-development activities. The cost of such activities during the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995, was $4,552,000, $4,735,000 and $4,791,000, respectively. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Registrant has settled the claim by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) for contribution toward the costs of remediation of the Municipal Waste Landfill, Cuba, NY, upon payment of $725,000. The Registrant did have insurance policies in effect during the period that waste was disposed of at the site, which the Company believes should provide indemnification of the Registrant's costs. ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES - ------------------- The Registrant owns one plant in Lumberton, North Carolina, and leases two plant facilities; one in Cuba, New York (with an option to purchase in accordance with a $500,000 20-year industrial revenue bond financing, subject to repayment of $3,500,000 of subordinate financing) and a second in Tempe, Arizona. The Registrant further leases facility space at a second location in Cuba, New York, and a warehouse in Tempe, Arizona. The Registrant concluded the sale of its idle facility located in West Jordan, Utah, in May 1997 for $525,000 net of expenses.

ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS - ------------------------------------------------------------ No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report to a vote of security holders through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise. PART II ITEM 5 - MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED SECURITY HOLDER MATTERS - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Information relating to the market and market prices of the Registrant's common stock, the approximate number of Registrant's shareholders and its dividend history for the past two fiscal years appears on page 24 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, submitted herewith as an exhibit and such information is incorporated by reference herein. Information relating to long-term debt for the past two fiscal years appears on page 19 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, submitted herewith as an exhibit and such information is incorporated by reference. The Registrant suspended its quarterly cash dividend effective the third quarter of fiscal 1991. The loss in fiscal 1991 resulted in a deficit of retained earnings. The Registrant, therefore, does not expect to reinstate dividends in the foreseeable future.

PAGE 10 OF ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIAL CONDITION: The Company has financed its working capital requirements and capital spending with cash from operating revenues. Total outstanding debt, including capital lease obligations, was reduced by approximately $5,200,000 in 1997. Debt reduction was achieved as a result of favorable cash flows generated from improved operational performances, including margin improvements in the Company's power distribution products and aerospace operations. Lower inventory and receivable requirements in the Company's electronics operation further contributed to the reduction. The total working capital of the Company was decreased by approximately $4,376,000 as of June 30, 1997. This reduction in working capital is attributable, in part, to the continued success of improved manufacturing flow techniques and vendor management programs, leading to both lower inventory level requirements in support of operations and better utilization of trade credit. Approximately $3,000,000 of the $4,376,000 working capital reduction is due to inventory, receivable and payable conversions to cash, as sales and related production of electronic products declined in the second half of the fiscal year. The Company has made appropriate adjustments in its electronics business to minimize the economic impact associated with the lower sales levels, while still maintaining the needed resources to develop new customer programs. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, the Company concluded the sale of its West Jordan, Utah, facility. The Company also sold 80,000 shares of treasury stock to the Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees of Acme Electric Corporation at fair market value on June 27, 1997. These two transactions provided combined proceeds of approximately $1,070,000. ____________________________________________________________ Dollars in thousands ____________________________________________________________ Years ended June 30 1997 1996 1995 ____________________________________________________________ Working Capital $16,719 $21,095 $22,599 ____________________________________________________________ Average Working Capital, as a percent of sales 20.0% 22.6% 23.0% ____________________________________________________________ Cash provided from (used in) Operations 5,748 3,549 (605) ____________________________________________________________ Current Ratio 2.3:1 2.8:1 2.5:1 ____________________________________________________________ Long-Term Debt to Equity 1.2:1 1.5:1 1.5:1 ____________________________________________________________ Capital expenditures and foreign investment combined were $2,531,000, $3,963,000 and $4,272,000 for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Included in the 1997 and 1996 expenditures is approximately $1,200,000 and $3,000,000, respectively, relating to the new business information system, of which $2,640,000 was financed through third-party lease arrangements. The fiscal 1995 expenditures included $1,500,000 of the Cuba, New York, plant construction costs. The Company anticipates capital expenditures will approximate $2,200,000 in 1998. The Company expects that operating activities in 1998 will produce net cash to fund these capital expenditures and any increase in working capital caused by increased business. At June 30, 1997, the Company had two secured term loans with a combined outstanding balance of $5,344,000, with interest terms of the lower of prime plus 1.5%, or 3% above the London Interbank Eurodollar rate, and a secured line of credit allowing for revolving loans and letters of credit up to $21,000,000 with interest at the lower of prime plus 1.0%, or the London Interbank Eurodollar rate plus 2.5%, with an outstanding balance of $9,788,000. The credit agreement, as amended, provides for a maturity date on the line of credit of December 31, 1998, while the $3,711,000 and $1,633,000 term loans have principal payments due through January 2, 2000, and July 1, 2001, respectively. The Company has purchased an interest-rate protection instrument that provides for a maximum interest rate of 9.6% on $15,000,000 of notional principal debt, currently expiring December 1, 1997, which will be renewed through December 31, 1998. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, interest coverage and debt-to-worth ratios and an annual capital expenditure threshold. At June 30, 1997, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. Management believes that current financing will provide adequate liquidity in the near term, with intentions to negotiate longer term facility commitments for the future. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company settled the Cuba, New York, landfill matter with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) upon payment of $725,000. The Company also negotiated favorable modifications with McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) concerning the MD-90 aircraft program, in return for which the Company will pay to MDC $237,000 over a six-month period, commencing July 1997. In addition, the Company concluded negotiations, resulting in an agreement with a second existing aerospace customer. The agreement contains performance incentive payments to be made to the Company, contingent upon meeting certain requirements, including but not limited to delivery schedules. The Company anticipates that the impact on fiscal 1998 cash flows related to these incentives will approximate $900,000.  PAGES 11 - 12 OF ANNUAL REPORT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: Acme Electric Corporation reported net income of $136,000, or $.03 per share, on net sales of $94,062,000 for the year ended June 30, 1997, compared with a net loss of $280,000, or $.06 per share, and net income of $992,000, or $.20 per share, for 1996 and 1995, respectively. Net loss from sales to the military/aerospace market for 1997 was $717,000, compared with losses of $1,699,000 and $1,219,000 in 1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company has continued to improve the effectiveness of its Tempe, Arizona, manufacturing operation, thereby better supporting customer product requirements. Sales to the military/aerospace market in 1997 were $8,645,000 compared to sales of $7,698,000 and $6,535,000 in 1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company's ability to generate profits from sales to the military/aerospace markets will be greatly dependent on its ability to continue improvements in manufacturing throughput and process variability at its Tempe facility. The Company realized an operating profit from its aerospace operations in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997. The overall fourth quarter of fiscal year 1997 resulted in a net loss of $178,000 on quarterly sales  of $23,355,000, or a net loss per share of $.03, compared with the results of the prior year's quarter of $24,040,000 sales, $148,000 net income and net income per share of $.03. The pre-tax loss for the quarter ended June 30, 1997, of $290,000 included the $725,000 Cuba-landfill settlement expense, the $237,000 contract settlement with the McDonnell Douglas Company associated with the MD-90 aircraft program, and a $60,000 loss incurred on the sale of the idle facility in West Jordan, Utah. These costs were partially offset by $300,000 of favorable fourth quarter events, including reduced accrued vacation charges due to personnel reductions and certain favorable resolutions of doubtful customer receivable balances. In a quarter-to-quarter comparison between fourth quarter 1997 and fourth quarter 1996, after excluding the unusual one-time type expenses (1996: $621,000), the 1996 fourth quarter performance (pre- tax income) bettered the current year quarter result by approximately $380,000. This was primarily a result of the decline in sales experienced by the Company's electronics business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997. QUARTERLY UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION Dollars in thousands - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fiscal Year 1997 1st Qtr. 2nd Qtr. 3rd Qtr. 4th Qtr. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Net Sales $23,223 $23,478 $24,006 $23,355 Net Income (Loss) 6 84 224 (178) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Annual sales decreased $2,489,000, or 2.6%, from the previous year, compared with an increase of $5,424,000, or 5.9%, in 1996 over 1995 levels. The decline in net sales is attributable to a declining sales trend experienced in the Company's electronics business, where sales decreased nearly $5,500,000 from 1996 levels. Management has currently addressed this situation and resized the work force consistent with current sales levels, with strategies in place to re-establish a positive sales trend, though improvement may be several quarters away. Improvement in both sales and profitability for the overall Company is anticipated through 1998, as favorable results are being produced from Demand Flow Technology implementation and management product strategies. Growth in sales will be dependent upon several factors, including the Company's ability to grow sales of its core line of products sold through distribution, both domestically and internationally, along with the ability to minimize the short-term operational disruptions associated with the continued implementation of advanced manufacturing techniques and the new business system. The Company's sales progression will further be contingent upon continued operational improvements at its Tempe, Arizona, manufacturing facility and its ability to attract new customer programs. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 76.2% in 1997, 77.6% in 1996, and 74.4% in 1995. The gross margin percentage improved from 22.3% in 1996 to 23.8% in 1997. This improvement reflects the Company's ability to increase prices on products sold through distribution and improved manufacturing performance at the Tempe, Arizona, facility. The Company's continued improvement in profit margins will be closely tied to the success of its efforts in growing the sales of its core products (transformers) sold through distribution, continued improvement in meeting customer delivery demands for its products sold to the military/aerospace market, and the success of its strategies to attract new customer programs in the electronics market. Research and engineering efforts were relatively constant in the three-year comparison, as expenses as a percent of sales were 4.8% in 1997, compared to 4.9% in 1996 and 5.2% in 1995. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 16.9% in 1997, compared with 15.5% in 1996 and 16.5% in 1995. Included in the 1997 expenses are the DEC settlement ($725,000), MD-90 contract modification costs ($237,000), and performance incentive costs accrued in excess of 1996 amounts (increase of $350,000) relating to the product distribution business performance. The percentage of sales decrease from 1995 to 1996 was mostly due to the increased sales levels in 1996 over 1995 without a corresponding increase in selling costs. Interest expense decreased nearly $570,000 from 1996 to 1997. The lower interest expense is the result of lower average outstanding debt balances maintained during 1997 in support of lower average working capital requirements. Interest expense increased by $400,000 from 1995 to 1996 due to higher average outstanding debt balances incurred in 1996. The Company's long-term debt originates from financing the military/aerospace business over the past ten years. Effective tax (benefit) rates for the most recent three years were 44.6%, (29.7%) and 38.4%, respectively. The fluctuations in the effective rates are generally reflective of the year-to- year variations in the permanent book-to-tax differences as a percent of pre- tax earnings (loss) and the Company's estimations as to the probable realizations of certain deferred state tax assets and minimum tax effects thereon. The Company did not record tax benefit for the loss from its 50%-owned foreign joint- venture and, as such, has generated a higher effective tax (or lower effective benefit)  PAGE 13 OF ANNUAL REPORT FIVE-YEAR COMPARISON OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA  PAGE 14 OF ANNUAL REPORT STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS Dollars in thousands (except per share amounts) _________________________________________________________________________ Years ended June 30 1997 1996 1995 _________________________________________________________________________ Net Sales $94,062 $96,551 $91,127 Costs and Expenses Cost of sales 71,681 74,964 67,837 Research and engineering expenses 4,552 4,735 4,791 Selling and administrative expenses 15,896 14,992 15,023 Interest expense 1,688 2,258 1,866 _________________________________________________________________________ Total Costs and Expenses 93,817 96,949 89,517 _________________________________________________________________________ Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes 245 (398) 1,610 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 109 (118) 618 _________________________________________________________________________ Net Income (Loss) $ 136 $ (280) $ 992 _________________________________________________________________________ Net Income (Loss) per Common Share $ .03 $ (.06) $ .20 _________________________________________________________________________ The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES: a. Acme Electric Corporation designs, manufactures and markets power conversion equipment for electronic and electrical systems. Principal markets encompass computers, test equipment, information systems, military, aerospace, telecommunications and a variety of industrial, commercial and residential applications requiring conversion of electrical energy from one useable state to another. b. The Company was a 50% owner in the Irish-based joint-venture, Acme Electric Limited (AEL). The parties to this venture dissolved and ceased joint operations effective October 1996. Prior to this date, the investment was recorded under the equity method of accounting. The Company's share of cumulative losses from inception, December 1994, approximated $420,000. c. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The major areas in which the Company utilizes estimates include deferred tax assets, reserves for insurance and legal claims, environmental liabilities, product warranty reserves, revenue recognition on long-term contracts, and the net realizable value of ce  rtain assets. The amounts contained within these financial statements represent management's best estimate of expected outcomes based on available information. However, the Company realizes that certain events could occur or fail to occur which would impact the estimates by a material amount in the future. d. The Company files a federal income tax return and various state returns. The Company follows the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial carrying values and the tax bases of the related assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. The deferred income tax provision for the period is the difference in the assets and liabilities as of the beginning and end of the period. e. Inventories are costed at the lower of cost or market and determined on a FIFO (first in, first out) basis. f. The Company utilizes the percentage-of-completion method for long- term contracts in its aerospace business. Revenues are recognized on the percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of material, labor and overhead costs incurred to date to total estimated material, labor and overhead costs for each long-term contract. g. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed on the straight-line and the sum-of-the-years'-digits methods over the estimated service lives of the assets. At the time of retirement or other disposition of properties, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gains or losses are reflected in income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; renewals and betterments are capitalized. The range of lives used as a basis for calculating depreciation is as follows: Years ______________________________________ Buildings 20-45 ______________________________________ Machinery and equipment 5-12 ______________________________________ Furniture and fixtures 8-10 ______________________________________ Automobiles and trucks 3-4 ______________________________________ h. Net income (loss) per common share computations are based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year as adjusted for outstanding stock options. In February 1997, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings per Share," was issued. SFAS No. 128 alters the computation and presentation of reported earnings per share. The Statement is required to be adopted for the interim reporting period ending December 1997. Earlier application is not permitted. The Company does not expect SFAS No. 128 to have a material affect on reported earnings per share. 2.

LONG-TERM DEBT: _____________________________________________________ Dollars in thousands 1997 1996 _____________________________________________________ Secured revolving loan $ 9,788 $13,288 Secured term loan with quarterly principal installments of $337,360 each, and interest paid monthly at the lower of prime plus 1.5%, or the Eurodollar (London Interbank Eurodollar) rate plus 3.0% through January 2, 2000. 3,711 4,723 Secured term loan with monthly principal installments of $33,333 each, and interest paid monthly at the lower of prime plus 1.5%, or the Eurodollar (LIBOR) rate plus 3.0% through July 1, 2001. 1,633 2,000 Secured loan on the Cuba facility payable over 20 years, with monthly payments for the first four years of interest only of $6,666, with monthly payments of $14,120, consisting of principal and interest at 4%, commencing September 1, 1997, and continuing over the remaining sixteen years. 2,000 2,000 Secured loan on the Cuba facility payable, with interest only at 1% through September 1, 1998, 36 monthly principal and interest payments of $9,396 at 3%, commencing October 1, 1998, and 168 monthly principal and interest payments of $11,347 at 6% due through September 2015. 1,500 1,500 Capital lease secured by new busi- ness information system equipment and a $900,000 letter of credit, payable in monthly installments of $42,662, consisting of principal and interest at 10.09%, maturing December 2001. 1,474 1,818 Capital lease secured by new busi- ness information system equipment with monthly installments of $20,546, consisting of principal and interest at 9.85%, maturing November 1999. 528 -- Capital lease obligation secured by related building, machinery and equipment at the Cuba, New York, facility, payable in quarterly principal installments of $5,208, with interest paid monthly on the unpaid balance at a rate of prime plus 1.5% through April 1, 2017. 427 448 Other debt 699 823 _____________________________________________________ Total debt 21,760 26,600 Current portion (2,562) (2,206) _____________________________________________________ Long-term portion $19,198 $24,394 _____________________________________________________ The Company has a credit agreement with a banking institution, which provides for borrowings and letters of credit up to a maximum of $26,344,000. This credit agreement is comprised of two secured term loans in the amount of $3,711,000 and $1,633,000 and a $21,000,000 secured revolving loan. The revolving loan carries an interest rate equal to the lower of prime plus 1.0%, or the London Interbank Eurodollar rate plus 2.5%, with a maturity date of December 31, 1998. The Company maintains interest rate protection, which allows for a maximum interest rate of 9.6% on $15,000,000 of notional principal debt. Outstanding borrowings against the revolving credit facility are limited by formula to specified amounts of accounts receivable and inventory, reduced by outstanding term debt. The Company pays a maximum annual commitment fee of 1/4 of 1% per annum on the unused portion. Under the terms of the credit agreement, the Company is required to meet certain restrictive covenants with respect to interest coverage and debt-to-worth ratios. The covenants further limit the Company's annual capital expenditure to a maximum of $2,200,000. At June 30, 1997, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. During the next five years, long-term debt matures as follows: 1998 - $2,562,000, 1999 - $2,691,000, 2000 - $2,257,000, 2001 - $924,000, and 2002 - - $220,000. These amounts do not include any maturities relating to the revolving loan. 5. STOCK OPTION PLANS: Options were granted under the 1981 Incentive Stock Option Plan at the fair market value on the day preceding the date of the grant and are exercisable in varying amounts through 1999. The 1981 Plan expired in October, 1992. Options granted under the 1981 Plan expire in accordance with their respective terms. Options are granted under the 1989 Incentive Stock Option Plan at the fair market value on the day preceding the date of the grant and are exercisable in varying amounts through 2006, with vesting at 25% a year from date of grant. An amendment of the 1989 Stock Option Plan was approved at the annual meeting of shareholders held on October 27, 1995, to apply a formula for the award of further options after each year of profitable operation and to increase the number of shares subject to the Plan from 225,000 to 450,000. In accordance with the formula, options will be granted for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997. The 1996 Directors' Stock Option Plan was adopted on April 29, 1996, by the Company's Board of Directors and approved by the Company's shareholders on October 31, 1996. Options are granted quarterly to each eligible director in lieu of Director Fees and are exercisable a full six months after the date of grant. The option price and number of shares optioned are determined by formula to replace the value of cash directors' fees otherwise due for the preceding quarter. A total of 50,000 shares of Common Stock are available for grant under the Plan. ______________________________________________________________ 1981 Plan 1989 Plan 1996 Directors' Shares Shares Plan Shares ______________________________________________________________ Options outstanding July 1, 1996 16,547 91,500 - Options granted - - 5,426 Options exercised - (6,500) - Options cancelled (5,512) (14,000) - ______________________________________________________________ Options outstanding 11,035 71,000 5,426 June 30, 1997 ______________________________________________________________ Options exercisable at June 30, 1997 11,035 43,250 - ______________________________________________________________ Exercise prices per share $5.72- $4.06- $1.89- $8.56 $11.25 $2.06 Shares available for options at June 30, 1997 - 268,004 44,574 ___________________________________________________________ The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for the stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized in 1997, 1996 or 1995 for stock option awards made from the 1989 Stoc  k Option Plan, since the exercise price of the stock options granted under the Stock Option Plan was not less than the fair market value of the Common Stock at date of grant. Had compensation expense for stock option awards granted in 1997 and 1996 been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, net income and earnings per share would be reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below: Dollars in thousands (except per share amounts) ______________________________________________________ Years ended June 30 1997 1996 ______________________________________________________ Net income (loss) As reported $136 $(280) Pro forma 66 (330) Net income (loss) per common share As reported $.03 $(.06) Pro forma .01 (.07) The Company used the Black Scholes pricing model to estimate the grant date present value of stock options granted in 1997 and 1996. The estimated value per option was approximately $3.80 for those options granted in 1997 and $4.60 for options granted in 1996. The values were calculated using the following assumptions: (i) an option term of 5.5 years (representing the estimated period between grant date and exercise date based on historical data); (ii) a risk-free interest rate approximating 6.48% in 1997 and 6.07% in 1996 (representing the yield on a U.S. Treasury Security with remaining term equal to the expected option term); (iii) expected volatility of 58% for 1997 and 1996; (iv) no future dividends paid; and (v) a 30% forfeiture rate used to reflect the estimate of the probability of forfeiture prior to vesting. The pro forma effects presented above are in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 123, however, such effects are not representative of the effects to be reported in future years due to the fact that options vest over several years, and additional awards generally are made each year. 6. LEASES: The Company leases certain manufacturing facilities and equipment, described in Note 4, under lease agreements which have been capitalized, and various other equipment under operating leases. Under the terms of the capital leases, the Company has included $4,436,000 and $3,798,000 in the cost of property, plant and equipment at June 30, 1997, and 1996, respectively. Accumulated depreciation on such assets was $1,074,000 and $1,040,000 at June 30, 1997, and 1996, respectively. Total rental expense under operating leases, which includes the headquarters facility, was $829,000, $1,038,000 and $1,130,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Minimum future rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are approximately $589,000 in 1998; $444,000 in 1999; $326,000 in 2000; $279,000 in 2001; and $275,000 in 2002. 7. INCOME TAXES: The provision for income taxes includes the following: Years Ended June 30 ____________________________________________________________ Dollars in thousands 1997 1996 1995 ____________________________________________________________ Current Federal Expense $ -- $ -- $ 49 State Expense 16 16 27 ____________________________________________________________ Deferred Federal Expense (Benefit) 130 (117) 518 State Expense (Benefit) (37) (17) 24 ____________________________________________________________ Total Provision (Benefit) $ 109 $ (118) $ 618 ____________________________________________________________ Total income tax expense (benefit) for fiscal years 1997, 1996 and 1995 resulted in effective tax (benefit) rates of 44.6%, (29.7%) and 38.4%, respectively. Differences between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate are as follows: _____________________________________________________________ 1997 1996 1995 _____________________________________________________________ Statutory rate (benefit) 34.0% (34.0%) 34.0% Foreign losses not tax effected 5.8% 18.2% 3.4% State taxes, net of federal benefit (5.6%) (.1%) 2.1% Reduction of accumulated reserve -- (17.0%) -- Other 10.4% 3.2% (1.1%) _____________________________________________________________ Effective tax (benefit) rate 44.6% (29.7%) 38.4% _____________________________________________________________ At June 30, the deferred tax assets (liabilities) were comprised of the following: _____________________________________________________________ Dollars in thousands 1997 1996 1995 _____________________________________________________________ Deferred tax assets: Accounts receivable $ 206 $ 156 $ 180 Inventory 446 376 285 Property, plant and equipment -- 186 330 Accrued expenses 696 744 554 Restructuring and impairment charges 463 779 1,028 Loss contingencies -- -- 224 Supplemental Executive Retirement 415 402 383 Other 201 89 139 Loss carry forward 1,511 1,111 754 _____________________________________________________________ 3,938 3,843 3,877 _____________________________________________________________ Deferred tax liabilities: Pensions (1,023) (915) (885) State taxes (207) (195) (189) Property, plant and equipment (81) -- -- _____________________________________________________________ (1,311) (1,110) (1,074) _____________________________________________________________ Net deferred tax asset $2,627 $2,733 $2,803 _____________________________________________________________ The Company has certain federal and state loss carry forwards available to offset future taxable income. The federal tax loss carry forward of $3,500,000 will have portions expire, if unused, in 2009. Portions of the state loss carry forwards, if not used, will expire in 1998.  8. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS RETIREMENT PLANS: The Company maintains three noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees. The plan covering salaried employees provides pension benefits based upon the employee's individual yearly compensation. Plans covering hourly employees provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of credited service. It is the Company's policy to fund for each qualified plan at least an amount necessary to satisfy the minimum requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The amount to be funded is subject to annual review by management and its consulting actuary. In recent years, funding contributions have been restricted due to application of Internal Revenue Code full-funding limitations to one or more of the plans. The Company also maintains a nonqualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for elected executive officers of the Company. The SERP provides benefits based upon an executive's compensation in the last year of service and is reduced by benefits received from the salaried plan. Six participants of this plan are retired and receiving payments under the plan. Approximately 5% of the plans' assets are invested in cash and equivalents, 47% are invested in equities, and the remaining 48% are invested in fixed-income securities and annuities. Net periodic pension expense for the three years ended June 30, 1997, included the following components: _________________________________________________________________ Dollars in thousands 1997 1996 1995 _________________________________________________________________ Service cost - Benefits earned during the period $ 630 $ 518 $ 521 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 1,537 1,521 1,441 Actual return on assets (2,203) (4,666) (1,398) Net amortization, deferral and curtailment gain 46 2,885 (505) _________________________________________________________________ Net periodic pension expense $ 10 $ 258 $ 59 _________________________________________________________________ For plans where: June 30, 1997 June 30, 1996 Assets Accumulated Assets Accumulated Exceed Benefits Exceed Benefits Accumulated Exceed Accumulated Exceed Benefits Assets Benefits Assets _________________________________________________________________ Actuarial present value of benefit obligations: Vested benefit obligation $(20,233) $(1,121) $(18,568) $(1,359) Accumulated benefit obligation (20,467) (1,376) (18,718) (2,751) Projected benefit obligation (21,933) (1,413) (20,082) (2,771) Plan assets at fair value 27,511 -- 25,172 1,350 _________________________________________________________________ Funded Status: Assets in excess of (or less than) projected benefit obligation 5,578 (1,413) 5,090 (1,421) Transition (asset) or obligation (551) 263 (645) 273 Unrecognized prior service cost 2,809 42 2,947 161 Unrecognized net (gain) or loss (5,272) 74 (5,107) (73) _________________________________________________________________ Prepaid (accrued) pension cost $ 2,564 $(1,034) $ 2,285 $(1,060) _________________________________________________________________ Pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" (SFAS 87), the Company has recorded $342,000 of additional unfunded accumulated benefit obligation attributable to the SERP plan at June 30, 1997. These unfunded obligations are recorded in other long-term liabilities. In addition, an intangible asset of the same amount has also been recorded. At June 30, 1997, and 1996, the discount rate for the benefit obligations was 7.0%, the assumed annual rate of increase in future compensation used in determining the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations was 4.5% for plans covering the salaried employees for both years, and the expected long-term annual rate of return on plan assets was 8.5% for plan years 1997 and 1996.
