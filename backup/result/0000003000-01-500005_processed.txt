FOURTH.   4.1  The total number of shares of all classes of     capital stock which the corporation shall have authority to issue     is one hundred twenty-six million (126,000,000), of which six     million (6,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, without par     value, issuable in one or more series, and one hundred twenty     million (120,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, par value One     Dollar ($1.00) per share, amounting in the aggregate to One     Hundred Twenty Million Dollars ($120,000,000).                         4.2  The Board of Directors is hereby expressly     authorized, at any time or from time to time, to divide any or     all of the shares of Preferred Stock into one or more series, and     in the resolution or resolutions establishing a particular     series, before issuance of any of the shares thereof, to fix and     determine the number of shares and the designation of such     series, so as to distinguish it from the shares of all other     series and classes, and to fix and determine the preferences,     voting rights, qualifications, privileges, limitations, options,     conversion rights, restrictions and other special or relative     rights of the Preferred Stock or of such series to the fullest     extent now or hereafter permitted by the laws of the State of     Delaware, including, but not limited to, the variations between     different series in the following respects:                              4.2.1     The distinctive designation of such     series and the number of shares which shall constitute such     series, which number may be increased or decreased (but not below     the number of shares thereof then outstanding) from time to time     by the Board of Directors;                              4.2.2     The annual dividend rate for such     series, and the date or dates from which dividends shall commence     to accrue;                              4.2.3     The price or prices at which, and     the terms and conditions on which, the shares of such series may     be made redeemable;                              4.2.4     The purchase or sinking fund     provisions, if any, for the purchase or redemption of shares of     such series;                              4.2.5     The preferential amount or amounts     payable upon shares of such series in the event of the     liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation;                              4.2.6     The voting rights, if any, of     shares of such series;                              4.2.7     The terms and conditions, if any,     upon which shares of such series may be converted and the class     or classes or series of shares of the corporation or other     securities into which such shares may be converted;                              4.2.8     The relative seniority, parity or     junior rank of such series as to dividends or assets with respect     to any other classes or series of stock then or thereafter to be     issued; and                              4.2.9     Such other terms, qualifications,     privileges, limitations, options, restrictions, and special or     relative rights and preferences, if any, of shares of such series     as the Board of Directors may, at the time of such resolution or     resolutions, lawfully fix and determine under the laws of the     State of Delaware.                         Unless otherwise provided in a resolution or     resolutions establishing any particular series, the aggregate     number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased     by an amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation approved     solely by a majority vote of the outstanding shares of Common     Stock (or solely with a lesser vote of the Common Stock, or     solely by action of the Board of Directors, if permitted by law     at the time).                         All shares of any one series shall be alike in     every particular, except with respect to the accrual of dividends     prior to the date of issuance.                  SERIES A PARTICIPATING CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK                                   Section 1.  Designation and Number of     Shares. The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series     A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock (without par value)"     (the "Series A Preferred Stock"). The number of shares initially     constituting the Series A Preferred Stock shall be 300,000;     provided, however, that, if more than a total of 300,000 shares     of Series A Preferred Stock shall be issuable by the corporation     upon the exercise of Rights (the "Rights") outstanding under the     Rights Agreement dated as of February 14, 1997 between Airborne     Freight Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("ABF"), and The Bank     of New York, a New York banking corporation, as Rights Agent (the     "Rights Agreement"), following the date (the "Effective Date") on     which the corporation succeeds to the rights and obligations of     ABF under the Rights Agreement in connection with the merger     pursuant to which ABF becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of the     corporation, the Board of Directors of the corporation, pursuant     to Section 151(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of     Delaware, shall direct by resolution or resolutions that a     certificate be properly executed, acknowledged, filed and     recorded, in accordance with the provisions of Section 103     thereof, providing for the total number of shares of Series A     Preferred Stock authorized to be issued to be increased (to the     extent that the Certificate of Incorporation then permits) to the     largest number of whole shares (rounded up to the nearest whole     number) issuable upon exercise of such Rights.                                   Section 2.  Dividends or Distributions.     (a) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of     shares of any other series of Preferred Stock or other class of     capital stock of the corporation ranking prior and superior to     the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends,     the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be     entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of     Directors, out of the assets of the corporation legally available     therefor, (1) quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day     of each fiscal quarter in each year, or such other dates as the     Board of Directors of the corporation shall approve (each such     date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment     Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date     after the first issuance of a share or a fraction of a share of     Series A Preferred Stock, in the amount of $30 per whole share     (rounded to the nearest cent) less the amount of all cash     dividends declared on the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to     the following clause (2) since the immediately preceding     Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first     Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any     share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (the     total of which shall not, in any event, be less than zero) and     (2) dividends payable in cash on the payment date for each cash     dividend declared on the Common Stock in an amount per whole     share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the Formula Number     (as hereinafter defined) then in effect times the cash dividends     then to be paid on each share of Common Stock. In addition, if     the corporation shall pay any dividend or make any distribution     on the Common Stock payable in assets, securities or other forms     of noncash consideration (other than dividends or distributions     solely in shares of Common Stock), then, in each such case, the     corporation shall simultaneously pay or make on each outstanding     whole share of Series A Preferred Stock a dividend or     distribution in like kind equal to the Formula Number then in     effect times such dividend or distribution on each share of the     Common Stock. As used herein, the "Formula Number" shall be 200;     provided, however, that, if at any time after the Effective Date,     the corporation shall (i) declare or pay any dividend on the     Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or make any     distribution on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii)     subdivide (by a stock split or otherwise) the outstanding shares     of Common Stock into a larger number of shares of Common Stock or     (iii) combine (by a reverse stock split or otherwise) the     outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of     shares of Common Stock, then in each such event the Formula     Number shall be adjusted to a number determined by multiplying     the Formula Number in effect immediately prior to such event by a     fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of     Common Stock that are outstanding immediately after such event     and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common     Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to such event (and     rounding the result to the nearest whole number); and provided     further that, if at any time after the Effective Date, the     corporation shall issue any shares of its capital stock in a     merger, reclassification, or change of the outstanding shares of     Common Stock, then in each such event the Formula Number shall be     appropriately adjusted to reflect such merger, reclassification     or change so that each share of Preferred Stock continues to be     the economic equivalent of a Formula Number of shares of Common     Stock prior to such merger, reclassification or change.                                        (b)  The corporation shall declare     a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as     provided in Section 2(a) immediately prior to or at the same time     it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other     than a dividend or distribution solely in shares of Common     Stock); provided, however, that, in the event no dividend or     distribution (other than a dividend or distribution in shares of     Common Stock) shall have been declared on the Common Stock during     the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the     next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of     $30 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless     be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.     The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the     determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock     entitled to receive a dividend or distribution declared thereon,     which record date shall be the same as the record date for any     corresponding dividend or distribution on the Common Stock.                                        (c)  Dividends shall begin to     accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A     Preferred Stock from and after the Quarterly Dividend Payment     Date next preceding the date of original issue of such shares of     Series A Preferred Stock; provided, however, that dividends on     such shares which are originally issued after the record date for     the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred     Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and on or prior to     the next succeeding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date shall begin     to accrue and be cumulative from and after such Quarterly     Dividend Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends     on shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are originally issued     prior to the record date for the determination of holders of     shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a     quarterly dividend on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date     shall be calculated as if cumulative from and after the last day     of the fiscal quarter next preceding the date of original     issuance of such shares. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not     bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred     Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends     at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated     pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the     time outstanding.                                        (d)  So long as any shares of the     Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividends or other     distributions shall be declared, paid or distributed, or set     aside for payment or distribution, on the Common Stock unless, in     each case, the dividend required by this Section 2 to be declared     on the Series A Preferred Stock shall have been declared.                                        (e)  The holders of the shares of     Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive any     dividends or other distributions except as provided herein.                                   Section 3.  Voting Rights.  The holders     of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following     voting rights:                                        (a)  Each holder of Series A     Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to     the Formula Number then in effect, for each share of Series A     Preferred Stock held of record on each matter on which holders of     the Common Stock or stockholders generally are entitled to vote,     multiplied by the maximum number of votes per share which any     holder of the Common Stock or stockholders generally then have     with respect to such matter (assuming any holding period or other     requirement to vote a greater number of shares is satisfied).                                        (b)  Except as otherwise provided     herein or by applicable law, the holders of shares of Series A     Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall     vote together as one class for the election of directors of the     corporation and on all other matters submitted to a vote of     stockholders of the corporation.                                        (c)  If, at the time of any annual     meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, the     equivalent of six quarterly dividends (whether or not     consecutive) payable on any share or shares of Series A Preferred     Stock are in default, the number of directors constituting the     Board of Directors of the corporation shall be increased by two.     In addition to voting together with the holders of Common Stock     for the election of other directors of the corporation, the     holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting     separately as a class to the exclusion of the holders of Common     Stock, shall be entitled at said meeting of stockholders (and at     each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders), unless all     dividends in arrears have been paid or declared and set apart for     payment prior thereto, to vote for the election of two directors     of the corporation, the holders of any Series A Preferred Stock     being entitled to cast a number of votes per share of Series A     Preferred Stock equal to the Formula Number. Until the default in     payments of all dividends which permitted the election of said     directors shall cease to exist, any director who shall have been     so elected pursuant to the next preceding sentence may be removed     at any time, either with or without cause, only by the     affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Series A     Preferred Stock at the time entitled to cast a majority of the     votes entitled to be cast for the election of any such director     at a special meeting of such holders called for that purpose, and     any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the vote of such     holders. If and when such default shall cease to exist, the     holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be divested of the     foregoing special voting rights, subject to revesting in the     event of each and every subsequent like default in payments of     dividends. Upon the termination of the foregoing special voting     rights, the terms of office of all persons who may have been     elected directors pursuant to said special voting rights shall     forthwith terminate, and the number of directors constituting the     Board of Directors shall be reduced by two. The voting rights     granted by this Section 3(c) shall be in addition to any other     voting rights granted to the holders of the Series A Preferred     Stock in this Section 3.                                        (d)  Except as provided herein, in     Section 11 or by applicable law, holders of Series A Preferred     Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall     not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote     with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for authorizing     or taking any corporate action.                                   Section 4.  Certain Restrictions. (a)     Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions     payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2     are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid     dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares     of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in     full, the corporation shall not                                             (i)  declare or pay dividends     on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or     otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking     junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution     or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;                                             (ii) declare or pay dividends     on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking     on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,     dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock,     except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and     all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in     arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders     of all such shares are then entitled;                                             (iii)     redeem or purchase     or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock     ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,     dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock;     provided that the corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or     otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for     shares of any stock of the corporation ranking junior (either as     to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to     the Series A Preferred Stock; or                                             (iv) purchase or otherwise     acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock,     or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A     Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made     in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of     Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the     Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual     dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the     respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will     result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective     series or classes.                                        (b)  The corporation shall not     permit any subsidiary of the corporation to purchase or otherwise     acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the corporation     unless the corporation could, under paragraph (a) of this Section     4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in     such manner.                                   Section 5.  Liquidation Rights.  Upon     the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation,     whether voluntary or involuntary, no distribution shall be made     (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as     to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to     the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders     of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received an     amount equal to the accrued and unpaid dividends and     distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of     such payment, plus an amount equal to the greater of (x) $100 per     whole share or (y) an aggregate amount per share equal to the     Formula Number then in effect times the aggregate amount to be     distributed per share to holders of Common Stock or (2) to the     holders of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or     upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A     Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series     A Preferred Stock and all other such parity stock in proportion     to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are     entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.                                   Section 6.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.     In case the corporation shall enter into any consolidation,     merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of     Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or     securities, cash or any other property, then in any such case the     then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the     same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per     share equal to the Formula Number then in effect times the     aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or any other property     (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which     each share of Common Stock is exchanged or changed. In the event     both this Section 6 and Section 2 appear to apply to a     transaction, this Section 6 will control.                                   Section 7.  No Redemption; No Sinking     Fund. (a) The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be     subject to redemption by the corporation or at the option of any     holder of Series A Preferred Stock except as set forth in Section     5 of Article Fourth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation     of the corporation; provided, however, that the corporation may     purchase or otherwise acquire outstanding shares of Series A     Preferred Stock in the open market or by offer to any holder or     holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock.                                        (b)  The shares of Series A     Preferred Stock shall not be subject to or entitled to the     operation of a retirement or sinking fund.                                   Section 8.  Ranking.  The Series A     Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of     Preferred Stock of the corporation unless the Board of Directors     shall specifically determine otherwise in fixing the powers,     preferences and relative, participating, optional and other     special rights of the shares of such series and the     qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof.                                   Section 9.  Fractional Shares. The     Series A Preferred Stock shall be issuable upon exercise of the     Rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement in whole shares or     in any fraction of a share that is one one-hundredth of a share     or any integral multiple of such fraction which shall entitle the     holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to     receive dividends, exercise voting rights, participate in     distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of     holders of Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of fractional     shares, the corporation, prior to the first issuance of a share     or a fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, may elect     (a) to make a cash payment as provided in the Rights Agreement     for fractions of a share other than one one-hundredths of a share     or any integral multiple thereof or (b) to issue depository     receipts evidencing such authorized fraction of a share of Series     A Preferred Stock pursuant to an appropriate agreement between     the corporation and a depository selected by the corporation;     provided that such agreement shall provide that the holders of     such depository receipts shall have all the rights, privileges     and preferences to which they are entitled as holders of the     Series A Preferred Stock.                                   Section 10.  Reacquired Shares.  Any     shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise     acquired by the corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be     retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All     such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but     unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to     series until such shares are once more designated as part of a     particular series by the Board of Directors pursuant to the     provisions of Section 4.2 of this Article Fourth.                                   Section 11.  Amendment.  None of the     powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and     other special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock as provided     herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended in     any manner which would alter or change the powers, preferences,     rights or privileges of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock     so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of     the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of     Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class; provided,     however, that no such amendment approved by the holders of at     least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred     Stock shall be deemed to apply to the powers, preferences, rights     or privileges of any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock     originally issued upon exercise of the Rights after the time of     such approval without the approval of such holder.                              4.3  Except for and subject to those rights     expressly granted to the holders of Preferred Stock or any series     thereof by resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of     Directors pursuant to Section 4.2 of this Article Fourth and     except as may be provided by the laws of the State of Delaware,     the holders of Common Stock shall have exclusively all other     rights of shareholders.                              4.4.1     The Bylaws shall divide the     directors into three classes and prescribe the tenure of office     of the several classes; but such Bylaws shall not provide for the     election of any class for a period shorter than from the time of     election following the division into classes until the next     annual meeting, and thereafter for a period shorter than the     interval between annual meetings or for a period longer than     three years and shall provide that the term of the office of at     least one class shall expire each year.  At all elections of     directors, voting shall be by class.                              4.4.2     At all elections of directors of     the corporation, each holder of shares of Common Stock shall be     entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number of votes     which (except for such provision as to cumulative voting) he     would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with     respect to his shares of stock multiplied by the number of     directors to be elected, and he may cast all of such votes for a     single director or may distribute them among the number to be     voted for, or for any two or more of them as he may see fit.               FIFTH.    The corporation is to have perpetual existence.               SIXTH.    6.1  In furtherance and not in limitation of the     powers conferred by statute, the board of directors is expressly     authorized:                              6.1.1     To make, alter or repeal the bylaws     of the corporation.                              6.1.2     To authorize and cause to be     executed mortgages and liens upon the real and personal property     of the corporation.                              6.1.3     To set apart out of any of the     funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve or     reserves for any proper purpose and to abolish any such reserve     in the manner in which it was created.                              6.1.4     By a majority of the whole board,     to designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of     two or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may     designate one or more directors as alternate members of any     committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at     any meeting of the committee. Any such committee, to the extent     provided in the resolution or in the bylaws of the corporation,     shall have and may exercise the powers of the board of directors     in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation,     and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to     all papers which may require it; provided, however, the by-laws     may provide that in the absence or disqualification of any member     of such committee or committees, the member or members thereof     present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether     or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint     another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in     the place of any such absent or disqualified member.                              6.1.5     When and as authorized by the     affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock issued     and outstanding having voting power given at a stockholders'     meeting duly called upon such notice as is required by statute,     or when authorized by the written consent of the holders of a     majority of the voting stock issued and outstanding, to sell,     lease or exchange all or substantially all of the property and     assets of the corporation, including its good will and its     corporate franchises, upon such terms and conditions and for such     consideration, which may consist in whole or in part of money or     property including shares of stock in, and/or other securities     of, any other corporation or corporations, as its board of     directors shall deem expedient and for the best interests of the     corporation.               SEVENTH.  7.1  Whenever a compromise or arrangement is     proposed between this corporation and its creditors or any class     of them and/or between this corporation and its stockholders or     any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the     State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of     this corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof, or on     the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this     corporation under the provisions of Section 291 of Title 8 of the     Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or     of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under     the provisions of Section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code     order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or     stockholders or class of stockholders of this corporation, as the     case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court     directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in     value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the     stockholders or class of stockholders of this corporation, as the     case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any     reorganization of this corporation as a consequence of such     compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and     the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to     which the said application has been made, be binding on all the     creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders     or class of stockholders, of this corporation, as the case may     be, and also on this corporation.               EIGHTH.   8.1  Meetings of shareholders may be held within     or without the State of Delaware as the Bylaws may provide.     Notwithstanding any provision of law, no action may be taken by     the shareholders, including without limitation amendment of this     Certificate or of the Bylaws, except at a meeting duly called in     accordance with the Bylaws.                         8.2  The books of this corporation may be kept     (subject to any provision contained in the statutes) outside the     State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated     from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of     the corporation. Election of Directors need not be by written     ballot unless the Bylaws of the corporation shall so provide.               NINTH.    9.1  The corporation shall at all times indemnify     its officers and directors from and against all expenses and     liabilities of whatsoever nature to the full extent permitted by     Delaware law, and without limiting the generality of the     foregoing, shall indemnify any director or officer or any former     director or former officer or any person who may have served at     its request as a director or officer of another corporation, and     the heirs, personal representatives and estates of each of them,     against all costs and expenses including attorneys' fees     reasonably incurred by him or imposed on him in connection with     any action, proceeding or investigation of whatsoever nature,     civil, administrative or criminal (including any shareholder's     action and any other action in which the corporation is a party,     plaintiff or defendant) in which he is or may be made a party or     is proceeded against or involved by reason of any action     whatsoever alleged to have been taken by him or omitted by him as     such director or officer, and against any liabilities, judgments,     fines, penalties or damages imposed against him in such action,     proceeding or investigation, or sums paid in settlement or     compromise thereof with the approval of the Board of Directors;     provided, that the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply     unless such person acted in a manner he reasonably believed to be     in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and     shall not apply if such person shall be duly and finally adjudged     (1) to be guilty of willful misconduct, bad faith or gross     negligence in the performance of his duties to the corporation,     in a derivative action or one brought by the corporation, or (2)     to be guilty of willful misconduct or bad faith, if such action     or proceeding is brought by a third party.                         9.2  Expenses incurred in defending such action,     proceeding or investigation may be paid by the corporation in     advance of the final disposition thereof as authorized by the     Board of Directors in the specific case and upon receipt of an     undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay     such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not     entitled to be indemnified by the corporation.                         9.3  The corporation shall have power to purchase     and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an     officer, director, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or     was serving at the request of the corporation as an officer,     director, employee and agent of another corporation, partnership,     joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability     whatsoever asserted against him and incurred by him in any such     capacity or arising out of his status as such, and against any     and all expenses in connection therewith, whether or not the     corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such     liability under the provisions of this certificate of     incorporation or under Delaware law.                    TENTH.    10.1  The corporation reserves the right to     amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this     certificate of incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter     prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders     herein are granted subject to this reservation.                    ELEVENTH. 11.1  A higher than majority shareholder vote     for certain Business Combinations shall be required as follows     (all capitalized terms being used as subsequently defined     herein):                              (a)  In addition to any affirmative vote     required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, and except     as otherwise expressly provided in Section 11.2 of this Article     Eleventh:                                   (1)  any merger or consolidation of the     corporation or any Subsidiary with (A) any Interested Shareholder     or with (B) any other corporation (whether or not itself an     Interested Shareholder) which is, or after such merger or     consolidation would be, an Affiliate or Associate of an     Interested Shareholder;                                   (2)  any sale, lease, exchange,     mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one     transaction or a series of transactions) to or with any     Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate or Associate of any     Interested Shareholder of any assets of the corporation or any     Subsidiary having an aggregate Fair Market Value of $10,000,000     or more;                                   (3)  the issuance or sale by the     corporation or any Subsidiary (in one transaction or a series of     transactions) of any securities of the corporation or any     Subsidiary to any Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate or     Associate of any Interested Shareholder in exchange for cash,     securities or other consideration (or a combination thereof)     having an aggregate Fair Market Value of $10,000,000 or more;                                   (4)  the adoption of any plan or     proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the corporation     proposed by or on behalf of any Interested Shareholder or any     Affiliate or associate of any Interested Shareholder; or                                   (5)  any reclassification of securities     (including any reverse stock split), or recapitalization of the     corporation, or any merger or consolidation of the corporation     with any of it Subsidiaries or any transaction (whether or not     with or into or otherwise involving an Interested Shareholder)     which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the     proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of     equity securities or securities convertible into equity     securities of the corporation or any Subsidiary which is directly     or indirectly owned by any Interested Shareholder or any     Affiliate or Associate of any Interested Shareholder; shall     require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of     the voting power of the then outstanding shares of common stock     of the corporation entitled to vote in an annual election of     directors, and at least 80% of the voting power of all shares of     all classes of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote     in an annual election of directors (all such stock of all classes     constituting the "Voting Stock"), voting together as a single     class. Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding     the fact that no vote may be required, or that a lesser     percentage may be specified, by law or in any agreement with any     national securities exchange or otherwise.                              (b)  The term "Business Combination" as used     in this Article Eleventh shall mean any transaction which is     referred to in any one or more of clauses (1) through (5) of     paragraph (a) of Section 11.1 of this Article Eleventh.                         11.2 The provisions of Section 11.1 of this     Article Eleventh shall not be applicable to any Business     Combination, and such Business Combination shall require only     such affirmative vote (if any) as is required by law, any other     provision of the Certificate of such corporation or any agreement     with any national securities exchange, if all of the conditions     specified in either of the following paragraphs (a) or (b) are     met:                              (a)  The Business Combination shall have been     approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors; or                              (b)  All of the following six conditions     shall have been met:                                   (1)  The transaction constituting the     Business Combination shall provide for a consideration to be     received by holders of Common Stock in exchange for their stock,     and the aggregate amount of the cash and the Fair Market Value as     of the date of the consummation of the Business Combination of     consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders     of Common Stock in such Business Combination shall be at least     equal to the highest of the following:                                        (A)  (if applicable) the highest     per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer     taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid in order to acquire any     shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Interested     Shareholder which were acquired (i) within the two-year period     immediately prior to the first public announcement of the     proposed Business Combination (the "Announcement Date") or (ii)     in the transaction in which it became an Interested Shareholder,     whichever is higher; and                                        (B)  the Fair Market Value per     share of Common Stock on the Announcement Date or on the date on     which the Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder     (the "Determination Date"), whichever is higher.                                   (2)  If the transaction constituting the     Business Combination shall provide for a consideration to be     received by holders of any class of outstanding Voting Stock     other than Common Stock, the aggregate amount of the cash and the     Fair Market Value as of the date of the consummation of the     Business Combination of consideration other than cash to be     received per share by holders of shares of such Voting Stock     shall be at least equal to the highest of the following (it being     intended that the requirements of this clause (b)(2) shall be     required to be met with respect to every class of outstanding     Voting Stock, whether or not the Interested Shareholder     beneficially owns any shares of a particular class of Voting     Stock):                                        (A)  (if applicable) the highest     per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer     taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid in order to acquire any     shares of such class of Voting Stock beneficially owned by the     Interested Shareholder which were acquired (i) within the two-     year period immediately prior to the Announcement Date or (ii) in     the transaction in which it became an Interested Shareholder,     whichever is higher;                                        (B)  (if applicable) the highest     preferential amount per share to which the holders of shares of     such class of Voting Stock are entitled in the event of any     voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up     of the corporation; and                                        (C)  the Fair Market Value per     share of such class of Voting Stock on the Announcement Date or     on the Determination Date, whichever is higher.                                   (3)  The consideration to be received by     holders of a particular class of outstanding Voting Stock     (including Common Stock) shall be in cash or in the same form as     was previously paid in order to acquire shares of such class of     Voting Stock which are beneficially owned by the Interested     Shareholder.

(4)  After such Interested Shareholder     has become an Interested Shareholder and prior to the     consummation of such Business Combination: (A) there shall have     been (i) no reduction in the annual rate of dividends paid on the     Common Stock (except as necessary to reflect any subdivision of     the Common Stock), except as approved by a majority of the     Continuing Directors, and (ii) an increase in such annual rate of     dividends (as necessary to prevent any such reduction) in the     event of any reclassification (including any reverse stock     split), recapitalization, reorganization or any similar     transaction which has the effect of reducing the number of     outstanding shares of the Common Stock, unless the failure so to     increase such annual rate is approved by a majority of the     Continuing Directors; and (B) such Interested Shareholder shall     not have become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of     Voting Stock except as part of the transaction in which it became     an Interested Shareholder.                                   (5)  After such Interested Shareholder     has become an Interested Shareholder, such Interested Shareholder     shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly     (except proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans,     advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or     any tax credits or other tax advantages provided by the     corporation, whether in anticipation of or in connection with     such Business Combination or otherwise.                                   (6)  A proxy or information statement     describing the proposed Business Combination and complying with     the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the     rules and regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions     replacing such Act, rules or regulations) shall be mailed to     public shareholders of the corporation at least 30 days prior to     the consummation of such Business Combination (whether or not     such proxy or information statement is required to be mailed     pursuant to such Act or subsequent provisions).                         11.3 For the purposes of this Article Eleventh:                              (a)  A "person" shall mean any individual,     firm, corporation or other entity.

(c)  A person shall be a "beneficial owner"     of any shares of Voting Stock:                                   (1)  which such person or any of its     Affiliates or Associates beneficially owns, directly or     indirectly;                                   (2)  which such person or any of its     Affiliates or Associates has (A) the right to acquire (whether or     not such right is exercisable immediately) pursuant to any     agreement, arrangements or understanding or upon the exercise of     conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or     otherwise, or (B) the right to vote pursuant to any agreement,     arrangement or understanding; or                                   (3)  which are beneficially owned,     directly or indirectly, by any other person with which such     person or any of its Affiliates or Associates has any agreement,     arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,     holding, voting or disposing of any shares of Voting Stock.                              (d)  For the purposes of determining whether     a person is an Interested Shareholder pursuant to paragraph (b)     of this Section 11.3, the number of shares of Voting Stock deemed     to be outstanding shall include shares deemed owned by an     Interested Shareholder through application of paragraph (c) of     this Section 11.3 but shall not include any other shares of     Voting Stock which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement,     arrangements or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion     rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise.

(f)  "Subsidiary" means any corporation of     which a majority of any class of equity security is owned,     directly or indirectly, by the corporation; provided, however,     that for the purposes of the definition of Interested Shareholder     set forth in paragraph (b) of this Section 11.3, the term     "Subsidiary" shall mean only a corporation of which a majority of     each class of equity security is owned, directly or indirectly,     by the corporation.

(i)  In the event of any Business Combination     in which the corporation survives, the phrase "consideration     other than cash to be received" as used in paragraph (b) of     Section 11.2 of this Article Eleventh shall include the shares of     Common Stock and/or the shares of any other class of outstanding     Voting Stock retained by the holders of such shares.                         11.4 The Board of Directors shall have the power     and duty to determine for the purpose of this Article Eleventh,     on the basis of information known to them after reasonable     inquiry (a) whether a person is an Interested Shareholder, (b)     the number of shares of Voting Stock beneficially owned by any     person, (c) whether a person is an Affiliate or Associate of     another, and (d) whether the assets which are the subject of any     business transaction which may be a Business Combination have, or     the consideration to be received for the issuance or transfer of     securities by the corporation or any Subsidiary in any     transaction which may be a Business Combination has, an aggregate     Fair Market Value of $10,000,000 or more. Any such determination     made in good faith shall be binding and conclusive on all     parties.                         11.5 Nothing contained in this Article Eleventh     shall be construed to relieve any Interested Shareholder from any     fiduciary obligation imposed by law.                         11.6 Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof     or of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the     corporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80%     of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Common     Stock, and at least 80% of the voting power of all of the then     outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as a single     class, shall be required to amend or repeal, or to adopt any     provision inconsistent with this Article Eleventh.

DATED as of the 15th day of December, 2000.                                        AIRBORNE FREIGHT CORPORATION,                                   Incorporator                                                  By  /s/   David C. Anderson                                        David C. Anderson                                        Corporate Secretary       EX-10 2 h3-exhibit10o.htm EXHIBIT 10(O) EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT  ABF EXHIBIT 10(o)  ###  EXHIBIT 10(o)                August 14, 2000          Mr. Richard Corrado     3529 264th Avenue SE     Samammish,  WA  98075          Dear Mr. Corrado,               Airborne Freight Corporation (the "Company") and its Board     of Directors are not necessarily opposed to any merger proposal     or acquisition attempt by third parties.  We recognize, and     insist that our executives recognize, that in such matters our     responsibility is to serve the best interests of our     shareholders in maximizing the worth and potential of their     investment.  However, the Company, as a publicly held     corporation, must be aware that insofar as it may be the     subject of acquisition attempts, such attempts do raise the     possibility of a change in control of the Company.  It further     recognizes that such a possibility can breed uncertainties as     to the continued tenure and fair treatment of key executives     regardless of their value to the corporation and their     individual merit.  The company is concerned that the     possibility of acquisition attempts and a change in control can     have an adverse effect on its retention of key management     personnel, and that such acquisition attempts can make it     difficult for such personnel to function most effectively in     the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.  In     light of these concerns, the Company's Board of Directors has     determined that it is appropriate to offer additional security     to certain key management personnel to better enable them to     function effectively without distraction in the event that     uncertainties as to the future control of the Company should     arise.               Therefore, to induce you to remain in the employ of the     Company and to encourage high level of effective management in     the best interests of the Company and shareholders, this letter     agreement sets forth certain benefits which the Company agrees     will be provided to you if your employment with the Company     should be terminated other than for cause, or by death,     disability or normal retirement, subsequent to a "change in     control" of the Company as defined and set forth in this     Agreement.  As the purpose of this Agreement is to provide you     with stability of job tenure without being discriminated     against because of activities on behalf of the Company and its     shareholders in the face of a possible "change in control" or     in the alternative to provide you with certain defined     severance benefits in the face of termination without cause or     upon discriminatory treatment after a "change in control," the     provisions of this Agreement with regard to benefits shall not     apply unless and until a "change in control" occurs.  Further,     the benefits set forth in paragraph 7 of this Agreement will     not be provided if you cease to be in the Company's employ,     even after a "change of control" and during the term of this     Agreement, because of death, normal retirement, disability,     "for cause," or because of voluntary termination by you without     "good reason" as they are defined herein.               1.   Term.  This Agreement will at all times have a two-     year term.  At such time as either you or the Company give     written notice to the other party that this Agreement is to be     terminated (such notice on your part to have no force or effect     unless given by you no later than two years after a "change in     control"), then this Agreement will expire two years from     receipt of the notice.  In any event, this Agreement will     terminate at your normal retirement date as defined herein.               2.   Change in Control.  For the purposes of invoking your     benefits under this Agreement, a "change in control" shall mean     the occurrence of any one of the following actions or events:                    (a)  The acquisition by any person of the power,     directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence     over the management or policies of the Company (either alone or     pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or more     other persons), whether through the ownership of voting     securities, through one or more intermediary persons, by     contract, or otherwise; or                    (b)  The acquisition by a person who is not a U.S.     citizen (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or     understanding with one or more other persons) of the ownership     or power to vote 25% or more of the outstanding voting     securities of the Company; or                    (c)  The acquisition by a person who is a U.S.     citizen (either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or     understanding with one ore more other persons) of the ownership     or power to vote 35% or more of the outstanding voting     securities of the Company; or                    (d)  If during a period of six years after the     acquisition by any person, directly or indirectly, of the     ownership or power to vote 10% or more of the outstanding     voting securities of the Company, the individuals who prior to     such acquisition were Directors of the Company ("Prior     Directors") shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board     of Directors, unless the nomination of each new Director was     approved by a vote of a majority of the Prior Directors;               The term "person" for purposes of this paragraph shall     include a natural person, corporation, partnership,     association, joint-stock company, trust fund, or organized     group of persons.               3.   Death, Retirement and Disability.  In the event of     your death, normal retirement, disability or voluntary     termination without good reason during the term hereof and     following a "change in control," you or your estate will be     entitled to receive only those applicable benefits under any     plans, programs and policies in effect with regard to the     executives or salaried employees of the Company.  For purposes     of this Agreement, normal retirement and disability are defined     as follows:                    (a)  Normal Retirement:  Termination by the Company     or you of your employment based on normal retirement shall mean     termination at age 65 or such earlier or later age set in     accordance with the retirement policy then generally in effect     with regard to the Company's salaried employees which is not     discriminatory as to you.  Normal retirement shall also include     retirement in accordance with any early or deferred retirement     age or date established with your consent.                    (b)  Disability:  Disability as grounds for     termination shall mean physical or mental illness resulting in     your absence from your duties with the Company on a full time     basis for 120 consecutive days following the exhaustion of all     current and accrued sick leave and vacation (as provided by     Company policy to all salaried employees on a nondiscriminatory     basis).  If within thirty (30) days after written notice of     proposed termination for disability is given by the Company,     you have not returned to the full time performance of your     duties, the Company may terminate your employment by giving     written Notice of Termination for "Disability."               4.   Other Termination Following a Change in Control.  If     a "change in control" occurs and you are subsequently     terminated as an employee by the Company during the term of     this Agreement (except for normal retirement, disability or for     cause as herein after defined) or if you terminate your employment     for good reason, as hereinafter defined, you will be entitled     to receive the benefits set forth in paragraph 7 hereof.               5.   Cause.  After a "change in control," the Company may     terminate your employment for "cause" without liability under     the benefit provisions hereof only upon:                    (a)  The willful and continued failure by you to     substantially perform your duties with the Company (other than     any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical     or mental illness), after a demand for substantial performance     is delivered to you by the Board which specifically identifies     the manner in which the Board believes that you have not     substantially performed your duties, or                    (b)  The willful engaging by you in gross misconduct     demonstrably injurious to the Company.               For the purpose of this paragraph, no act, or failure to     act, on your part shall be considered "willful" if done, or     omitted to be done, by you in good faith and in the reasonable     belief that your act or omission was in the best interests of     the Company.  You shall not be deemed to have been terminated     for cause unless and until you receive a copy of a resolution     duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-     quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of     the Board called and held for that purpose (after reasonable     notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your     counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the     good faith opinion of the Board you were guilty of conduct set     forth in clauses (a) or (b) of the first sentence of this     paragraph and specifying the particulars thereof.                If your employment is terminated for cause, the Company     shall pay you your then current full base salary plus vacation     and any other compensation actually accrued through the date of     termination, and the Company shall have no further obligation     to you.               6.   Good Reason.  You may regard your employment as     constructively terminated by the Company, and yourself     terminate your employment for "good reason" following a "change     in control" and during the term hereof, receiving the benefits     set forth in paragraph 7, upon the happening of one or more of     the following events which will constitute good reason for your own     termination of your employment:                    (a)  Without your express written consent, the     assignment to you of any duties not customarily performed by     officers of the Company and inconsistent with your position as     an officer prior to a "change in control," or the failure of     the Company to maintain you in an officer position; or to     provide you with the normal prerequisites of an officer of the     Company, including but not limited to an office and appropriate     support services;                    (b)  A reduction by the Company in your base salary     as in effect prior to a "change in control" unless such     reduction is applied to all officers of the company and does     not exceed the average percentage reduction in base salary for     all officers of the Company, with a maximum permissible     reduction of 25%, or the failure by the Company to increase     such base salary each year following a "change in control" by     an amount which equals at least one-half (), on a percentage     basis, the average percentage increase in base salary for all     officers of the Company, and its subsidiaries, or any parent or     successor the Company during the prior two full calendar years;                    (c)  A failure by the Company to maintain any of the     employee benefits to which you are entitled prior to a "change     in control" at a level equal to or greater than that in effect     prior to a "change in control," through the continuation of the     same or substantially similar plans, programs and policies, or     the taking of any action by the Company which would adversely     affect your participation in or materially reduce your benefits     under any such plans, programs or policies or deprive you of     any fringe benefits enjoyed by you prior to a "change in     control," unless such a reduction in benefits is     nondiscriminatory as to you and is applied generally.                    (d)  The failure by the Company to provide you with     the number of paid vacation days to which you would be entitled     as a salaried employee of the Company, its subsidiaries or     affiliates, or any parent or successor of the Company on a     nondiscriminatory basis.                    (e)  The Company's requiring you to be based anywhere     other than your current location except for required travel on     the Company's business to an extent substantially consistent     with your present business travel obligations; or the     relocation of your offices outside of their current location     without your consent.                    (f)  Any purported termination of your employment by     the Company which is not effected pursuant to the notice of     termination and procedures required by the specific provision     relied upon (i.e., Disability, or Cause), or normal retirement     as defined in paragraph 3 hereof, or any purported termination     for which the grounds relied upon are not valid.               Upon the happening of one or more of these events, should     you choose to regard your employment as constructively     terminated, delivery of a written notice of termination setting     forth the "good reason" therefor will entitle you to the     benefits as set forth in paragraph 7 hereof.               7.   Compensation Upon Termination Without Cause or     Termination for Good Reason.  If after a "change in control"     and during the term hereof, you are terminated by the Company     other than by reason of normal retirement, disability or for     cause under the definitions and procedures as set forth herein,     or you choose to terminate your employment for good reason as     set forth herein, then the Company shall pay to you the     following amounts:                    (a)  Your full base salary through the date of any     Notice of Termination plus payment for all accrued vacation,     and any deferred compensation to which you are entitled for the     year most recently ended and the pro rata share of any such     compensation which would be due in the year of termination, up     to the date of termination, to the extent not already paid;     plus                    (b)  An amount equal to:                         (i)  The sum of your annual base salary at the     rate in effect as of your termination plus the amount of any     additional compensation awarded you for the year most recently     ended (whether or not fully paid), including any sums awarded     under a Management Incentive Compensation Plan, multiplied by:                         (ii)  The number two.  If your normal retirement     date is less than two (2) years from your termination date,     then the multiplier shall be that fraction remaining until your     normal retirement date rounded to the nearest tenth (i.e., 18     months equals 1.5, 8 months equals .7).                         (iii)  With regard to the Company's Profit     Sharing Plan and Minimum Monthly Income Retirement Plan, the     Company shall pay a lump sum equal to the amount forfeited by     you, if any, under such plan which would have vested if your     employment had continued for the remaining term of this     Agreement.                         (iv)  The Company shall maintain in full force     and effect for the remaining term of this Agreement prior to     your normal retirement date, all other employee benefit plans,     programs and policies (including any life or health insurance     plans) in which you were entitled to participate immediately     prior to your termination, provided that your continued     participation is possible under the general terms and     provisions of such plans, programs and policies.  In the event     that your participation in any such plan, program or policy is     not possible under its terms and conditions, the Company shall     arrange to provide you with benefits substantially similar to     those which you would have been entitled to receive under each     plan, program or policy.  At the end of the period of coverage,     you will have the option to have assigned to you at no cost and     with no apportionment of prepaid premiums, any assignable     insurance policy owned by the Company and relating to you and     to take advantage of any conversion privileges pertinent to the     benefits available under Company policies.                         (v)  In addition to the payment of benefits to     which you are entitled under the qualified retirement plans     maintained by the Company in which you are a participant on the     date of your termination, the Company shall pay you in cash at     age 65 or such earlier retirement date permitted under the plan     or plans as you may elect, an amount equal to the sum of the     following:  (a) the amount which would have been contributed to     your Profit Sharing Plan account had you continued in the     employ of the Company for an additional two years [prior to     your normal retirement date] at your base salary rate as of the     date of termination and based on the average profit-sharing     contribution allocated to your account for the three years     preceding your termination, which amount shall be adjusted for     an increase or decrease in value in the same percentage as the     increase or decrease in your Profit Sharing account between the     date of your termination and the date of payment; and (b) the     difference between the actuarial equivalent of the amount which     you are entitled to receive, if any, under the Minimum Monthly     Retirement Income Plan and the amount which you would have     received from such plan if you had continued in the employ of     the Company for an additional two years [prior to your normal     retirement date].  If your normal retirement date would occur     during that two-year period, then the amount of such additional     compensation shall be calculated on the basis that your     employment continued to that date.  For the purposes of the     calculation of benefits under the Minimum Monthly Retirement     Income Plan, the "actuarial equivalent" shall be determined by     assuming your survival to age 80.                         (vi)  At your option, in lieu of shares of     common stock of the Company, without par value ("Company     Shares") issuable upon exercise of options ("Options"), if any,     granted to you under the Airborne Key Employee's Stock Option     and Stock Appreciation Rights Plans (to which options employee     waives all rights upon the making of the payment referred to     below), you shall receive an amount in cash equal to the     difference between the exercise prices of all Options held by     you whether or not then fully exercisable, and the higher of     (a) the mean between the closing bid and asked prices on the     New York Stock Exchange on the date of termination or (b) the     highest price per Company Share actually paid in connection     with any change in control of the Company.               8.   Payments and Disputes.  For purposes of this     Agreement, your date of termination will be the date written     notice of termination is given by the Company to you.  If     termination is under circumstances invoking the benefits or     paragraph 7, then the sums specified therein will be paid no     more than ten (10) working days after the date of termination,     except that the portion of the payment bases upon the amounts     payable under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan and     the Profit Sharing Plan shall be paid no later than ten (10)     working days after the amounts payable under such plans have     been determined following availability of results necessary for     computation of such amounts.               In the event that the Company wishes to contest or dispute     a termination for "good reason" by you, it must give written     notice of such dispute within the five day period after the     date of termination.  If you wish to contest or dispute a     termination by the Company, or any failure to make payments     claimed to be due hereunder, you must give written notice of     such dispute within thirty days of receiving a Notice of     Termination [or, if no Notice is provided, within thirty days     of your actual termination by the Company].  In the event of a     dispute, the Company shall continue to pay your full base     salary and continue all your employee benefits in force until     final resolution of any such dispute by mutual agreement or the     final judgment, decree or order of a court of competent     jurisdiction (including any appeals, if such are perfected).     You may, at your or the Company's option, be suspended from all     duties during the pendency of such a contest or dispute.  If     you prevail in any such contest or dispute, the Company shall     thereupon be liable for the full amounts due under paragraph 7     as of the date of termination after adjustments for amounts     already paid.               The Company will pay all fees and expenses, including full     attorneys' fees, incurred by you in good faith in contesting or     disputing any termination after a "change in control" or in     seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by     this Agreement.               In the event that any payments due hereunder shall be     delayed for any reason for more than ten working days from the     date of termination (or availability of results under the     Management Incentive Compensation Plan and Profit Sharing Plan     as above provided), the amounts due shall bear the maximum     legal rate of interest until paid.               Notwithstanding the provisions as to time of payment as     above set forth, you may at your sole option elect to have some     or all of such amounts due you deferred to date or dates of     your choosing over a period not to exceed two years, in which     event the unpaid balances shall not bear interest during the     deferred period elected by you.               9.   Mitigation.  You shall not be required to mitigate     the amount of any payment due under paragraph 7 by seeking     other employment.  If you should accept a position with another     employer after your date of termination and during the period     of provision of benefits under paragraph 7, then the Company     shall have no further liability for the provision of benefits     or further payments under section (b)(iv) of paragraph 7, and     the remaining term of this Agreement for purposes of Section     (b)(v) of paragraph 7 will terminate as of the date of your new     employment.               10.  Covenant for Confidentiality and Not to Compete.

You     further agree that for a period of one year following the     termination of your employment with the Company you will continue     to keep all Company information confidential and that you will     not enter into the employment in an executive or consultant     capacity or serve on the Board of Directors of any enterprise     in whatever form organized and carried on which is directly     competitive with any business activity then conducted by the     Company or its subsidiaries within the continental United States.               11.

Unless defined elsewhere herein, capitalized terms used in     this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in     Exhibit I.                               PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS               Seller desires to transfer and assign Receivable Interests     from time to time.               Blue Ridge shall purchase Receivable Interests from Seller     from time to time either by issuing its Commercial Paper or by     availing itself of a Liquidity Funding to the extent available.               Wachovia Bank, N.A. has been requested and is willing to act     as Administrative Agent on behalf of Blue Ridge and its assigns     in accordance with the terms hereof.                                      ARTICLE I                                PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS               Section 1.1    Purchase Facility.               (a)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this     Agreement (including, without limitation, Article VI), from time     to time prior to the Facility Termination Date, Seller may     request that Blue Ridge purchase from Seller undivided ownership     interests in the Receivables and the associated Related Security     and Collections, and Blue Ridge shall make such Purchase;     provided that no Purchase shall be made by Blue Ridge if, after     giving effect thereto, either (i)the Aggregate Invested Amount     would exceed the Purchase Limit, or (ii) the aggregate of the     Receivable Interests would exceed 100%.  It is the intent of Blue     Ridge to fund the Purchases by the issuance of Commercial Paper.     If for any reason Blue Ridge is unable, or determines that it is     undesirable, to issue Commercial Paper to fund or maintain its     investment in the Receivable Interests, or is unable for any     reason to repay such Commercial Paper upon the maturity thereof,     Blue Ridge will avail itself of a Liquidity Funding to the extent     available.  If Blue Ridge funds or refinances its investment in a     Receivable Interest through one or more Liquidity Fundings,     commencing on the date of such Liquidity Funding, in lieu of     paying CP Costs on the Invested Amount pursuant to Article III     hereof, Seller will pay Yield thereon at the Alternate Base Rate     or the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted), selected in accordance     with Article IV hereof.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to     constitute a commitment of Blue Ridge to issue Commercial Paper.               (b)  Seller may, upon at least 30 Business Days' notice to     the Administrative Agent, terminate in whole or reduce in part,     the unused portion of the Purchase Limit; provided that each     partial reduction of the Purchase Limit shall be in an amount     equal to $10,000,000 (or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000     if in excess thereof).               Section 1.2    Incremental Purchases.               Seller shall provide the Administrative Agent with at least     two (2) Business Days' prior written notice in a form set forth     as Exhibit II hereto of each Incremental Purchase (each, a     "Purchase Notice").  Each Purchase Notice shall be subject to     Section 6.2 hereof and, except as set forth below, shall be     irrevocable (subject to the proviso below) and shall specify the     requested Purchase Price (which shall not be less than $1,000,000     or a larger integral multiple of $100,000) and the Purchase Date     (which, in the case of any Incremental Purchase after the initial     Purchase hereunder, shall only be on a Settlement Date).     Following receipt of a Purchase Notice, the Administrative Agent     will determine whether Blue Ridge will fund the requested     Incremental Purchase through the issuance of Commercial Paper or     through a Liquidity Funding; provided, however that if the     Administrative Agent shall determine that Blue Ridge will fund     such Incremental Purchase through a Liquidity Funding, it shall     notify the Seller of such determination and the Seller may cancel     such Purchase Notice.  On each Purchase Date, upon satisfaction     of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article VI,     unless otherwise instructed in the applicable Purchase Notice     Blue Ridge shall deposit to the Facility Account an amount equal     to the requested Purchase Price.               Section 1.3    Decreases.               Seller shall provide the Administrative Agent with prior     written notice in conformity with the Required Notice Period (a     "Reduction Notice") of any proposed reduction of Aggregate     Invested Amount.  Such Reduction Notice shall designate (a) the     date (the "Proposed Reduction Date") upon which any such     reduction of Aggregate Invested Amount shall occur (which date     shall give effect to the applicable Required Notice Period), and     (b) the amount of Aggregate Invested Amount to be reduced, which     shall be applied to reduce the Invested Amount of Receivable     Interests selected by the Administrative Agent (the "Aggregate     Reduction").  Only one (1) Reduction Notice shall be outstanding     at any time.               Section 1.4    Deemed Collections; Purchase Limit.               (a)  If on any day:                    (i)  the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable is          reduced as a result of any defective, rejected or returned          goods or services, any cash discount or any other adjustment          by the Servicer, the Originator or any Affiliate thereof, or          as a result of any tariff or other governmental or          regulatory action, or                    (ii) the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable is          reduced or canceled as a result of a setoff in respect of          any claim by the Obligor thereof (whether such claim arises          out of the same or a related or an unrelated transaction),          or                    (iii)     the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable is          reduced on account of the obligation of the Seller, the          Servicer, the Originator or any Affiliate thereof to pay to          the related Obligor any rebate or refund, or                    (iv) the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable is less          than the amount included in calculating the Net Pool Balance          for purposes of any Monthly Report (for any reason other          than receipt of Collections or such Receivable becoming a          Defaulted Receivable), or                    (v)  any of the representations or warranties of Seller          set forth in Section 5.1(g), (i), (j), (r), (s), (t) or (u)          were not true when made with respect to any Receivable, or                    (vi) any Receivable is repurchased by the Originator          pursuant to the Receivables Sale Agreement,          then, on such day, Seller shall (x) be deemed to have received a     Collection of such Receivable (A) in the case of clauses (i)-(iv)     above, in the amount of such reduction or cancellation or the     difference between the actual Outstanding Balance and the amount     included in calculating such Net Pool Balance, as applicable; and     (B) in the case of clause (v) above, in the amount of the     Outstanding Balance of such Receivable as of the date on which     such representation or warranty was made and (y) pay to the     Administrative Agent's Account the amount of any such Collection     deemed to have been received on the date such Collection is so     deemed to have been received.               (b)  Seller shall ensure that the Aggregate Invested Amount     at no time exceeds the lesser of (i) the Net Pool Balance and     (ii) the Purchase Limit.  If at any time the Aggregate Invested     Amount exceeds the Purchase Limit, Seller shall pay to the     Administrative Agent not later than two (2) Business Days after     the first day such excess exists an amount to be applied to     reduce the Aggregate Invested Amount (as allocated by the     Administrative Agent), such that after giving effect to such     payment the Aggregate Invested Amount is less than or equal to     the Purchase Limit.               (c)  Seller shall also ensure that the Receivable Interests     shall at no time exceed in the aggregate 100%.  If the aggregate     of the Receivable Interests exceeds 100%, Seller shall pay to the     Administrative Agent not later than two (2) Business Days after     the first day such excess exists an amount to be applied to     reduce the Aggregate Invested Amount (as allocated by the     Administrative Agent), such that after giving effect to such     payment the aggregate of the Receivable Interests equals or is     less than 100%.               Section 1.5    Payment Requirements and Computations.               All amounts to be paid or deposited by any Seller Party     pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be paid or     deposited in accordance with the terms hereof no later than 2:00     p.m. (New York time)] on the day when due in immediately     available funds, and if not received before 2:00 p.m. (New York     time)] shall be deemed to be received on the next succeeding     Business Day.  If such amounts are payable to the Administrative     Agent for the account of Blue Ridge, they shall be paid to the     Administrative Agent's Account, for the account of Blue Ridge     until otherwise notified by the Administrative Agent.  Upon     notice to Seller, the Administrative Agent may debit the Facility     Account for all amounts due and payable hereunder.  All     computations of CP Costs, Yield, per annum fees calculated as     part of any CP Costs, per annum fees hereunder and   per annum fees under the Fee Letter shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed. If any amount hereunder shall be payable on a day which is not a Business Day, such amount shall be payable on the next succeeding Business Day. ARTICLE II PAYMENTS AND COLLECTIONS Section 2.1 Payments of Recourse Obligations. Seller hereby promises to pay the following (collectively, the "Recourse Obligations"): (a) all amounts due and owing under Section 1.3 or 1.4 on the dates specified therein; (b) the fees set forth in the Fee Letter on the dates specified therein; (c) all accrued and unpaid Yield on the Receivable Interests accruing Yield at the Alternate Base Rate or the Default Rate on each Settlement Date applicable thereto; (d) all accrued and unpaid Yield on the Receivable Interests accruing Yield at the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted), on the last day of each Tranche Period applicable thereto; (e) all accrued and unpaid CP Costs on the Receivable Interests funded with Commercial Paper on each Settlement Date; and (f) all Broken Funding Costs and Indemnified Amounts upon demand. Section 2.2 Collections Prior to the Facility Termination Date.

If at any time any Collections are received by the Servicer prior to the Facility Termination Date, Seller hereby requests and Blue Ridge hereby agrees to make subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, simultaneously with such receipt, a reinvestment (each, a "Reinvestment") with Blue Ridge's Portion of the balance of each and every Collection received by the Servicer such that after giving effect to such Reinvestment, the Invested Amount of such Receivable Interest immediately after such receipt and corresponding Reinvestment shall be equal to the amount of Invested Amount immediately prior to such receipt. (b) On each Settlement Date prior to the Facility Termination Date, the Servicer shall remit to the Administrative Agent's Account the amounts set aside during the preceding Settlement Period that have not been subject to a Reinvestment and apply such amounts (if not previously paid in accordance with Section 2.1) to the Aggregate Unpaids in the order specified: first, ratably to the payment of all accrued and unpaid CP Costs, Yield and Broken Funding Costs (if any) that are then due and owing, second, to the accrued and unpaid Servicing Fee (so long as Servicer is not the Originator or an Affiliate of the Originator) third, ratably to the payment of all accrued and unpaid fees under the Fee Letter (if any) that are then due and owing, fourth, if required under Section 1.3 or 1.4, to the ratable reduction of Aggregate Invested Amount, fifth, for the ratable payment of all other unpaid Recourse Obligations, if any, that are then due and owing, sixth, to the accrued and unpaid Servicing Fee (so long as Servicer is the Originator or an Affiliate of the Originator) seventh, the balance, if any, to Seller or otherwise in accordance with Seller's instructions. Section 2.3 Application of Collections. On the Facility Termination Date and on each day thereafter, the Servicer shall set aside and hold in trust, for the Secured Parties, all Collections received on each such day.

Section 2.4 Payment Recission. No payment of any of the Aggregate Unpaids shall be considered paid or applied hereunder to the extent that, at any time, all or any portion of such payment or application is rescinded by application of law or judicial authority, or must otherwise be returned or refunded for any reason. Seller shall remain obligated for the amount of any payment or application so rescinded, returned or refunded, and shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent (for application to the Person or Persons who suffered such recission, return or refund) the full amount thereof, plus interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of any such recission, return or refunding. Section 2.5 Clean Up Call. In addition to Seller's rights pursuant to Section 1.3, Seller shall have the right (after providing written notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Required Notice Period), at any time following the reduction of the Aggregate Invested Amount to a level that is less than 10.0% of the original Purchase Limit, to repurchase all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding Receivable Interests. The purchase price in respect thereof shall be an amount equal to the Aggregate Unpaids through the date of such repurchase, payable in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent's Account. Such repurchase shall be without representation, warranty or recourse of any kind by, on the part of, or against Blue Ridge or the Administrative Agent. ARTICLE III COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING Section 3.1 CP Costs. Seller shall pay CP Costs with respect to the Invested Amount of all Receivable Interests funded through the issuance of Commercial Paper. Each Receivable Interest that is funded with Pooled Commercial Paper will accrue CP Costs each day on a pro rata basis, based upon the percentage share that the Invested Amount in respect of such Receivable Interest represents in relation to all assets held by Blue Ridge and funded substantially with related Pooled Commercial Paper. Section 3.2 Calculation of CP Costs. Not later than the 3rd Business Day immediately preceding each Monthly Reporting Date, Blue Ridge shall calculate the aggregate amount of CP Costs applicable to its Receivable Interests for the Calculation Period then most recently ended and shall notify Seller of such aggregate amount. Section 3.3 CP Costs Payments. On each Settlement Date, Seller shall pay to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of Blue Ridge) an aggregate amount equal to all accrued and unpaid CP Costs in respect of the Invested Amount of all Receivable Interests funded with Commercial Paper for the Calculation Period then most recently ended in accordance with Article II. Section 3.4 Default Rate. From and after the occurrence of an Amortization Event, all Receivable Interests shall accrue Yield at the Default Rate. ARTICLE IV LIQUIDITY FUNDINGS Section 4.1 Liquidity Fundings. Prior to the occurrence of an Amortization Event, the outstanding Invested Amount of each Receivable Interest funded with a Liquidity Funding shall accrue Yield for each day during its Tranche Period at either the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) or the Alternate Base Rate in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. Until Seller gives the required notice to the Administrative Agent of another Yield Rate in accordance with Section 4.4, the initial Yield Rate for any Receivable Interest funded with a Liquidity Funding shall be the Alternate Base Rate (unless the Default Rate is then applicable). If any undivided interest in a Receivable Interest initially funded with Commercial Paper is sold to the Liquidity Banks pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement, such undivided interest in such Receivable Interest shall be deemed to have a Tranche Period commencing on the date of such sale. Section 4.2 Yield Payments. On the Settlement Date for each Receivable Interest that is funded with a Liquidity Funding, Seller shall pay to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Liquidity Banks) an aggregate amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Yield thereon for the entire Tranche Period of each such Liquidity Funding in accordance with Article II. Section 4.3 Selection and Continuation of Tranche Periods. (a) Tranche Periods for the Receivable Interests funded with Liquidity Fundings shall be selected from time to time (i) prior to the occurrence of an Amortization Event, by Seller with consultation from (and approval by) the Administrative Agent provided that if at any time any Liquidity Funding is outstanding, Seller shall always request Tranche Periods such that at least one Tranche Period shall end on the date specified in clause (A) of the definition of Settlement Date and (ii) from and after the occurrence of an Amortization Event, by the Administrative Agent; (b) The Administrative Agent or, prior to the occurrence of an Amortization Event, Seller (with the consent of the Administrative Agent), upon notice to the other received at least three (3) Business Days prior to the end of a Tranche Period (the "Terminating Tranche") for any Liquidity Funding, may, effective on the last day of the Terminating Tranche: (i) divide any such Liquidity Funding into multiple Liquidity Fundings, (ii) combine any such Liquidity Funding with one or more other Liquidity Fundings that have a Terminating Tranche ending on the same day as such Terminating Tranche or (iii) combine any such Liquidity Funding with a new Liquidity Funding to be made by the Liquidity Banks on the day such Terminating Tranche ends. Section 4.4 Liquidity Funding Yield Rates. Subject to Sections 4.5 and 4.6, Seller may select the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) or the Alternate Base Rate for each Liquidity Funding. Seller shall by 12:00 noon (New York time): (a) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the expiration of any Terminating Tranche with respect to which the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) is being requested as a new Yield Rate and (b) at least one (1) Business Day prior to the expiration of any Terminating Tranche with respect to which the Alternate Base Rate is being requested as a new Yield Rate, give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice of the new Yield Rate for the Liquidity Funding associated with such Terminating Tranche. Until Seller gives notice to the Administrative Agent of another Yield Rate, the initial Yield Rate for any Receivable Interest assigned or participated to the Liquidity Banks pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement shall be the Alternate Base Rate (unless the Default Rate is then applicable). Section 4.5 Suspension of the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted). (a) If any Liquidity Bank notifies the Administrative Agent that it has determined that funding its ratable share of the Liquidity Fundings at a Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive of any governmental or regulatory authority, whether or not having the force of law, or that (i) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund its Liquidity Funding at such Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) are not available or (ii) such Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) does not accurately reflect the cost of acquiring or maintaining a Liquidity Funding at such Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted), then the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) shall be suspended and the Alternate Base Rate shall apply to any Liquidity Funding accruing Yield at such Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted). (b) If less than all of the Liquidity Banks give a notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 4.5(a), each Liquidity Bank which gave such a notice shall be obliged, at the request of Seller, Blue Ridge or the Administrative Agent, to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder to (i) another Liquidity Bank or (ii) another funding entity nominated by Seller or the Administrative Agent that is an Eligible Assignee willing to participate in the Liquidity Agreement through the Liquidity Termination Date in the place of such notifying Liquidity Bank; provided that (i) the notifying Liquidity Bank receives payment in full of all Aggregate Unpaids owing to it (whether due or accrued), and (ii) the replacement Liquidity Bank otherwise satisfies the requirements of the Liquidity Agreement.

Such Seller Party has complied in all respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject, except where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Receivable, together with the Contract related thereto, does not contravene any laws, rules or regulations applicable thereto (including, without limitation, laws, rules and regulations relating to truth in lending, fair credit billing, fair credit reporting, equal credit opportunity, fair debt collection practices and privacy), and no part of such Contract is in violation of any such law, rule or regulation, except where such contravention or violation could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (r) Compliance with Credit and Collection Policy. Such Seller Party has complied in all material respects with the Credit and Collection Policy with regard to each Receivable and the related Contract, and has not made any change to such Credit and Collection Policy, except for such changes made in accordance with Section 7.1(a)(vii). (s) Payments to Originator. With respect to each Receivable transferred to Seller under the Receivables Sale Agreement, Seller has given reasonably equivalent value to the Originator in consideration therefor and such transfer was not made for or on account of an antecedent debt.

(x) Taxes. Such Seller Party has filed all tax returns and reports required by law to be filed by it and has paid all taxes and governmental charges due and owing, except any such taxes which are not yet owing or are being diligently contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP have been set aside on its books.

The failure of Seller to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions precedent in respect of any Reinvestment shall give rise to a right of the Administrative Agent, which right may be exercised at any time on demand of the Administrative Agent, to rescind the related purchase and direct Seller to pay to the Administrative Agent's Account, for the benefit of Blue Ridge, an amount equal to the Collections prior to the Facility Termination Date that shall have been applied to the affected Reinvestment.

(i) Reliance. Seller acknowledges that the Administrative Agent and Blue Ridge are entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in reliance upon Seller's identity as a legal entity that is separate from the Originator. Therefore, from and after the date of execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller shall take all reasonable steps, including, without limitation, all steps that the Administrative Agent or Blue Ridge may from time to time reasonably request, to maintain Seller's identity as a separate legal entity and to make it manifest to third parties that Seller is an entity with assets and liabilities distinct from those of the Originator and any Affiliates thereof (other than Seller) and not just a division of the Originator or any such Affiliate. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in addition to the other covenants set forth herein, Seller will: (i) conduct its own business in its own name and require that all full- time employees of Seller, if any, identify themselves as such and not as employees of the Originator (including, without limitation, by means of providing appropriate employees with business or identification cards identifying such employees as Seller's employees);

(iii) clearly identify its offices (by signage or otherwise) as its offices and, if such office is located in the offices of the Originator, Seller shall lease such office at a fair market rent; (iv) have a separate telephone number, which will be answered only in its name and separate stationery and checks, if it uses any, in its own name; (v) conduct all transactions with the Originator and the Servicer (including, without limitation, any delegation of its obligations hereunder as Servicer) strictly on an arm's-length basis, allocate all overhead expenses (including, without limitation, telephone and other utility charges) for items shared between Seller and the Originator on the basis of actual use to the extent practicable and, to the extent such allocation is not practicable, on a basis reasonably related to actual use; (vi) at all times have a Board of Directors consisting of three members, at least one member of which is an Independent Director; (vii) observe all corporate formalities as a distinct entity, and ensure that all corporate actions relating to (A) the selection, maintenance or replacement of the Independent Director, (B) the dissolution or liquidation of Seller or (C) the initiation of, participation in, acquiescence in or consent to any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding involving Seller, are duly authorized by unanimous vote of its Board of Directors (including the Independent Director); (viii) maintain Seller's books and records separate from those of the Originator and any Affiliate thereof and otherwise readily identifiable as its own assets rather than assets of the Originator or any Affiliate thereof; (ix) prepare its financial statements separately from those of the Originator and insure that any consolidated financial statements of the Originator or any Affiliate thereof that include Seller and that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental agency have notes clearly stating that Seller is a separate corporate entity and that its assets will be available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Seller; (x) except as herein specifically otherwise provided, maintain the funds or other assets of Seller separate from, and not commingled with, those of the Originator or any Affiliate thereof and only maintain bank accounts or other depository accounts to which Seller alone is the account party, into which Seller and Servicer, for the account of Seller, make deposits and from which Seller alone (or the Administrative Agent hereunder) has the power to make withdrawals; (xi) pay all of Seller's operating expenses from Seller's own assets (except for certain payments by the Originator or other Persons pursuant to allocation arrangements that comply with the requirements of this Section 7.1(i)); (xii) operate its business and activities such that: it does not engage in any business or activity of any kind, or enter into any transaction or indenture, mortgage, instrument, agreement, contract, lease or other undertaking, other than the transactions contemplated and authorized by this Agreement and the Receivables Sale Agreement; and does not create, incur, guarantee, assume or suffer to exist any indebtedness or other liabilities, whether direct or contingent, other than (1) as a result of the endorsement of negotiable instruments for deposit or collection or similar transactions in the ordinary course of business, (2) the incurrence of obligations under this Agreement, (3) the incurrence of obligations, as expressly contemplated in the Receivables Sale Agreement, to make payment to the Originator thereunder for the purchase of Receivables from the Originator under the Receivables Sale Agreement, and (4) the incurrence of operating expenses in the ordinary course of business of the type otherwise contemplated by this Agreement; (xiii) maintain its corporate charter in conformity with this Agreement, such that it does not amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws in any respect that would impair its ability to comply with the terms or provisions of any of the Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, Section 7.1(i) of this Agreement; (xiv) maintain the effectiveness of, and continue to perform under the Receivables Sale Agreement and the Performance Undertaking, such that it does not amend, restate, supplement, cancel, terminate or otherwise modify the Receivables Sale Agreement or the Performance Undertaking, or give any consent, waiver, directive or approval thereunder or waive any default, action, omission or breach under the Receivables Sale Agreement or the Performance Undertaking or otherwise grant any indulgence thereunder, without (in each case) the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent; (xv) maintain its corporate separateness such that it does not merge or consolidate with or into, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of (whether in one transaction or in a series of transactions, and except as otherwise contemplated herein) all or substantially all of its assets (whether now owned or hereafter acquired) to, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, any Person, nor at any time create, have, acquire, maintain or hold any interest in any Subsidiary. (xvi) maintain at all times the Required Capital Amount (as defined in the Receivables Sale Agreement) and refrain from making any dividend, distribution, redemption of capital stock or payment of any subordinated indebtedness which would cause the Required Capital Amount to cease to be so maintained; and (xvii) take such other actions as are necessary on its part to ensure that the facts and assumptions set forth in the opinion issued by Riddell Williams P.S. counsel for Seller, in connection with the closing or initial Purchase under this Agreement and relating to substantive consolidation issues, and in the certificates accompanying such opinion, remain true and correct in all material respects at all times. (j) Collections.

Seller will maintain exclusive ownership, dominion and control (subject to the terms of this Agreement) of each Lock-Box and Blocked Account and shall not grant the right to take dominion and control of any Lock-Box or Blocked Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event to any Person, except to the Administrative Agent as contemplated by this Agreement. (k) Taxes.

Seller shall not be permitted to further delegate to any other Person any of the duties or responsibilities of the Servicer delegated to it by Originator. If at any time the Administrative Agent shall designate as Servicer any Person other than Originator, all duties and responsibilities theretofore delegated by Originator to Seller may, at the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be terminated forthwith on notice given by the Administrative Agent to Originator and to Seller. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection (b): (i) Originator shall be and remain primarily liable to the Administrative Agent and Blue Ridge for the full and prompt performance of all duties and responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder and (ii) the Administrative Agent and Blue Ridge shall be entitled to deal exclusively with Originator in matters relating to the discharge by the Servicer of its duties and responsibilities hereunder. The Administrative Agent and Blue Ridge shall not be required to give notice, demand or other communication to any Person other than Originator in order for communication to the Servicer and its sub- servicer or other delegate with respect thereto to be accomplished.

The Servicer shall cause to be established and maintained one or more Lock-Boxes and Blocked Accounts in the name of the Seller and shall effect a Blocked Account Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit VI with each bank party to a Blocked Account at any time and shall cause a Delivery Order to be executed and delivered with respect to each Lock- Box at any time. In the case of any remittances received in any Lock-Box or Blocked Account that shall have been identified, to the satisfaction of the Servicer, to not constitute Collections or other proceeds of the Receivables or the Related Security, the Servicer shall promptly remit such items to the Person identified to it as being the owner of such remittances. From and after the date the Administrative Agent delivers to any Blocked Account Bank a Collection Notice pursuant to Section 8.3, or delivers to the US Postal Service a Delivery Order relating to a Lock-Box, the Administrative Agent may request that the Servicer, and the Servicer thereupon promptly shall instruct all Obligors with respect to the Receivables, to remit all payments thereon to a new depositary account or Lock-Box specified by the Administrative Agent and, at all times thereafter, Seller and the Servicer shall not deposit or otherwise credit, and shall not permit any other Person to deposit or otherwise credit to such new depositary account any cash or payment item other than Collections or, if a Delivery Order has been presented with respect to a Lock-Box, Seller and Servicer shall not remove any receipts from such Lock- Box, but the Administrative Agent or its designee shall remove all such receipts from such Lock-Box. (c) The Servicer shall administer the Collections in accordance with the procedures described herein and in Article II. The Servicer shall set aside and hold in trust for the account of Seller and Blue Ridge their respective shares of the Collections in accordance with Article II.

(d) The Servicer may, in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any Receivable or adjust the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable as the Servicer determines to be appropriate to maximize Collections thereof; provided, however, that such extension or adjustment shall not alter the status of such Receivable as a Delinquent Receivable or Defaulted Receivable or limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or Blue Ridge under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Administrative Agent shall have the absolute and unlimited right after the earlier to occur of an Unmatured Amortization Event and an Amortization Event to direct the Servicer to commence or settle any legal action with respect to any Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any Related Security. (e) The Servicer shall hold in trust for Seller and the Administrative Agent and Blue Ridge all Records that (i) evidence or relate to the Receivables, the related Contracts and Related Security or (ii) are otherwise necessary or desirable to collect the Receivables and shall, as soon as practicable upon demand of the Administrative Agent, deliver or make available to the Administrative Agent all such Records, at a place selected by the Administrative Agent.

(f) Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by it to Originator or Seller shall, except as otherwise specified by such Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law and unless otherwise instructed by the Administrative Agent, be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor (starting with the oldest such Receivable) to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being applied to any other receivable or other obligation of such Obligor. Section 8.3 Collection Notices and Delivery Orders. The Administrative Agent is authorized at any time after the occurrence of an Amortization Event to date and to deliver to the Blocked Account Banks the Collection Notices and deliver to the US Postal Service the Delivery Orders. Seller hereby transfers to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of Blue Ridge, effective when the Administrative Agent delivers such notice, the exclusive ownership and control of each Lock-Box and the Blocked Accounts. In case any authorized signatory of Seller whose signature appears on a Blocked Account Agreement or a Delivery Order shall cease to have such authority before the delivery of such notice, such Collection Notice or Delivery Order, as the case may be, shall nevertheless be valid as if such authority had remained in force. Seller hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, and agrees that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled (a) at any time after delivery of the Collection Notices and/or the Delivery Orders, to endorse Seller's name on checks and other instruments representing Collections, (b) at any time after the occurrence of an Amortization Event, to enforce the Receivables, the related Contracts and the Related Security, and (c) at any time after the occurrence of an Amortization Event, to take such action as shall be necessary or desirable to cause all cash, checks and other instruments constituting Collections of Receivables to come into the possession of the Administrative Agent rather than Seller.

Section 10.2 Increased Cost and Reduced Return. If after the date hereof, any Funding Source shall be charged any fee, expense or increased cost on account of the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation (including any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy) or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency (a "Regulatory Change"): (a) that subjects any Funding Source to any charge or withholding on or with respect to any Funding Agreement or a Funding Source's obligations under a Funding Agreement, or on or with respect to the Receivables, or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any Funding Source of any amounts payable under any Funding Agreement (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of a Funding Source or taxes excluded by Section 10.1) or (b) that imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of a Funding Source, or credit extended by a Funding Source pursuant to a Funding Agreement or (c) that imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the cost to a Funding Source of performing its obligations under a Funding Agreement, or to reduce the rate of return on a Funding Source's capital as a consequence of its obligations under a Funding Agreement, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by a Funding Source under a Funding Agreement or to require any payment calculated by reference to the amount of interests or loans held or interest received by it, then, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, Seller shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the relevant Funding Source, such amounts charged to such Funding Source or such amounts to otherwise compensate such Funding Source for such increased cost or such reduction.

This Undertaking constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Performance Guarantor enforceable against Performance Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

The execution and delivery by Performance Guarantor of this Undertaking, and the performance of its obligations hereunder do not contravene or violate (i) its certificate or articles of incorporation or by- laws, (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any agreement, contract or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding on or affecting it or its property, and do not result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on assets of Performance Guarantor or its Subsidiaries (except as created hereunder) except, in any case, where such contravention or violation could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (d) Financial Statements. The consolidated financial statements of Performance Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries dated as of December 31, 1999 and September 30, 2000 heretofore delivered to Recipient have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Performance Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for the periods ended on such dates. Since the later of (i) September 30, 2000 and (ii) the last time this representation was made or deemed made, no event has occurred which would or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (e) Taxes. Performance Guarantor has filed all United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by Performance Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided. The United States income tax returns of Performance Guarantor have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service through the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999. No federal or state tax liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such taxes. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of Performance Guarantor in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are adequate. (f) Litigation and Contingent Obligations. Except as disclosed in the filings made by Performance Guarantor with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of Performance Guarantor's knowledge threatened against or affecting Performance Guarantor or any of its properties, in or before any court, arbitrator or other body, that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on (i) the business, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Performance Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) the ability of Performance Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Undertaking, or (iii) the validity or enforceability of any of this Undertaking or the rights or remedies of Recipient hereunder. Performance Guarantor does not have any material Contingent Obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section 6(d). Section 7. Subrogation; Subordination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, until the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full Performance Guarantor: (a) will not enforce or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation to any of the rights of Recipient, the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Originator, (b) hereby waives all rights of subrogation (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, at law or in equity or otherwise) to the claims of Recipient, the Administrative Agent and the Purchaser against the Originator and all contractual, statutory or legal or equitable rights of contribution, reimbursement, indemnification and similar rights and "claims" (as that term is defined in the United States Bankruptcy Code) which Performance Guarantor might now have or hereafter acquire against the Originator that arise from the existence or performance of Performance Guarantor's obligations hereunder, (c) will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against the Originator in respect of any liability of Performance Guarantor to such Originator and (d) waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by Beneficiaries, the Administrative Agent or the Purchaser. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of the Originator now or hereafter owed to Performance Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. Performance Guarantor agrees that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Performance Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of the Originator to Performance Guarantor until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid and performed in full. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Performance Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still unperformed or outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by Performance Guarantor as trustee for Recipient (and its assigns) and be paid over to Recipient (or its assigns) on account of the Guaranteed Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of Performance Guarantor under the other provisions of this Undertaking. The provisions of this Section 7 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of Recipient under any separate subordination agreement which Recipient may at any time and from time to time enter into with Performance Guarantor. Section 8. Termination of Performance Undertaking. Performance Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect until all Obligations are finally paid and satisfied in full and the Credit and Security Agreement is terminated, provided that this Undertaking shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or other satisfaction of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of the Originator or otherwise, as though such payment had not been made or other satisfaction occurred, whether or not Recipient (or its assigns) is in possession of this Undertaking. No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability by reason of the federal bankruptcy code or any insolvency or other similar law, or any law or order of any government or agency thereof purporting to reduce, amend or otherwise affect the Guaranteed Obligations shall impair, affect, be a defense to or claim against the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking. Section 9. Effect of Bankruptcy. This Performance Undertaking shall survive the insolvency of the Originator and the commencement of any case or proceeding by or against the Originator under the federal bankruptcy code or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes. No automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code with respect to the Originator or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes to which the Originator is subject shall postpone the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking. Section 10. Setoff. Regardless of the other means of obtaining payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Recipient (and its assigns) is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to Performance Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived by Performance Guarantor) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any deposits and other sums against the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking, whether or not Recipient (or any such assign) shall have made any demand under this Undertaking and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Section 11. Taxes. All payments to be made by Performance Guarantor hereunder shall be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding. If Performance Guarantor is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of tax or otherwise from any such payment, the sum due from it in respect of such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, Recipient receive a net sum equal to the sum which they would have received had no deduction or withholding been made. Section 12. Further Assurances. Performance Guarantor agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of Recipient (or its assigns), provide information relating to the business and affairs of Performance Guarantor as Recipient may reasonably request. Performance Guarantor also agrees to do all such things and execute all such documents as Recipient (or its assigns) may reasonably consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Undertaking and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of Recipient hereunder. Section 13. Successors and Assigns. This Performance Undertaking shall be binding upon Performance Guarantor, its successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Recipient and its successors and assigns. Performance Guarantor may not assign or transfer any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each of Recipient and the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Recipient may assign or otherwise transfer the Agreements, any other documents executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder or any other agreement or note held by them evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other entity or other person, and such other entity or other person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in respect thereof granted to the Beneficiaries herein. Section 14. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Undertaking nor consent to any departure by Performance Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Recipient, the Administrative Agent and Performance Guarantor. No failure on the part of Recipient to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. Section 15. Notices. All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be addressed as follows: if to Performance Guarantor, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto, and if to Recipient, at the addresses set forth beneath its signature hereto, or at such other addresses as each of Performance Guarantor or any Recipient may designate in writing to the other.

Section 18. Bankruptcy Petition. Performance Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior Indebtedness of Recipient, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, Recipient any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other similar proceeding under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States. Section 19. Miscellaneous. This Undertaking constitutes the entire agreement of Performance Guarantor with respect to the matters set forth herein. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or any other agreement, and this Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty of or collateral security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The provisions of this Undertaking are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of Performance Guarantor hereunder would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of Performance Guarantor's liability under this Undertaking, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Undertaking to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by Performance Guarantor or Recipient, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding. Any provisions of this Undertaking which are prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Note. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Airborne Credit, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("SPV"), hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of Airborne Express, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Originator"), in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds, on or before the date following the Termination Date which is one year and one day after the date on which (i) the Outstanding Balance of all Receivables sold by Originator under the "Sale Agreement" referred to below has been reduced to zero and (ii) Originator has paid to Buyer all indemnities, adjustments and other amounts which may be owed thereunder in connection with the Purchase thereunder (the "Collection Date"), the aggregate unpaid principal sum outstanding of all "Subordinated Loans" made from time to time by Originator to SPV pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of that certain Receivables Sale Agreement dated as of December 28, 2000 among Originator, as seller, and SPV, as buyer (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Sale Agreement"). Reference to Section 1.2 of the Sale Agreement is hereby made for a statement of the terms and conditions under which the loans evidenced hereby have been and will be made. All terms which are capitalized and used herein and which are not otherwise specifically defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Sale Agreement. 2. Interest. SPV further promises to pay interest on the outstanding unpaid principal amount hereof from the date hereof until payment in full hereof at a rate equal to the 1-month LIBOR rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the first Business Day of each month (or portion thereof) during the term of this Subordinated Note, computed for actual days elapsed on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days and changing on the first business day of each month hereafter ("LIBOR"); provided, however, that if SPV shall default in the payment of any principal hereof, SPV promises to pay, on demand, interest at the rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum on any such unpaid amounts, from the date such payment is due to the date of actual payment. Interest shall be payable on the first Business Day of each month in arrears; provided, however, that SPV may elect on the date any interest payment is due hereunder to defer such payment and upon such election the amount of interest due but unpaid on such date shall constitute principal under this Subordinated Note. The outstanding principal of any loan made under this Subordinated Note shall be due and payable on the Collection Date and may be repaid or prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. 3. Principal Payments. Originator is authorized and directed by SPV to enter on the grid attached hereto, or, at its option, in its books and records, the date and amount of each loan made by it which is evidenced by this Subordinated Note and the amount of each payment of principal made by SPV, and absent manifest error, such entries shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information so entered; provided that neither the failure of Originator to make any such entry or any error therein shall expand, limit or affect the obligations of SPV hereunder. 4. Subordination. Originator shall have the right to receive, and SPV shall make, any and all payments and prepayments relating to the loans made under this Subordinated Note provided that, after giving effect to any such payment or prepayment, the aggregate Outstanding Balance of Receivables (as each such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement hereinafter referred to) owned by SPV at such time exceeds the sum of (a) the Aggregate Principal (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) outstanding at such time under the Purchase Agreement, plus (b) the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all loans made under this Subordinated Note. Originator hereby agrees that at any time during which the conditions set forth in the proviso of the immediately preceding sentence shall not be satisfied, Originator shall be subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of any indebtedness or obligation of SPV owing to the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser under that certain Purchase Agreement dated as of December 28, 2000 by and among SPV, Airborne Express, Inc., as initial Servicer, various "Purchasers" from time to time party thereto, and Wachovia Bank, N.A., as the "Administrative Agent" (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Purchase Agreement"). The subordination provisions contained herein are for the direct benefit of, and may be enforced by, the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers and/or any of their respective assignees (collectively, the "Senior Claimants") under the Purchase Agreement. Until the date on which the "Aggregate Principal" outstanding under the Purchase Agreement has been repaid in full and all other obligations of SPV and/or the Servicer thereunder and under the "Fee Letter" referenced therein (all such obligations, collectively, the "Senior Claim") have been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full, Originator shall not institute against SPV any proceeding of the type described in Section 5.1(d) of the Sale Agreement unless and until the Collection Date has occurred. Should any payment, distribution or security or proceeds thereof be received by Originator in violation of this Section 4, Originator agrees that such payment shall be segregated, received and held in trust for the benefit of, and deemed to be the property of, and shall be immediately paid over and delivered to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Senior Claimants. 5. Bankruptcy; Insolvency. Upon the occurrence of any proceeding of the type described in Section 5.1(d) of the Sale Agreement involving SPV as debtor, then and in any such event the Senior Claimants shall receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of the Aggregate Principal and the Senior Claim (including "Interest" as defined and as accruing under the Purchase Agreement after the commencement of any such proceeding, whether or not any or all of such Interest is an allowable claim in any such proceeding) before Originator is entitled to receive payment on account of this Subordinated Note, and to that end, any payment or distribution of assets of SPV of any kind or character, whether in cash, securities or other property, in any applicable insolvency proceeding, which would otherwise be payable to or deliverable upon or with respect to any or all indebtedness under this Subordinated Note, is hereby assigned to and shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or delivery (whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver, custodian or liquidating trustee or otherwise) directly to the Administrative Agent for application to, or as collateral for the payment of, the Senior Claim until such Senior Claim shall have been paid in full and satisfied. 6. Amendments. This Subordinated Note shall not be amended or modified except in accordance with Section 7.1 of the Sale Agreement. The terms of this Subordinated Note may not be amended or otherwise modified without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers. 7. GOVERNING LAW.

Time stamped receipt copies of proper UCC termination statements, if any, necessary to release all security interests and other rights of any Person in the Receivables, Contracts or Related Security previously granted by each Originator. 6.

A favorable opinion of legal counsel for Originator reasonably acceptable to Buyer (and the Administrative Agent, as Buyer's assignee) as to the following: (a) Originator is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware. (b) Originator has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction where failure to be so qualified would have a material adverse effect on such Originator's business. (c) The execution and delivery by Originator of the Receivables Sale Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party and its performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary organizational action and proceedings on the part of Originator and will not: (i) require any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official (other than the filing of UCC financing statements); (ii) contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of its articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon Originator; or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on assets of Originator or any of its Subsidiaries (except as contemplated by the Receivables Sale Agreement). (d) The Receivables Sale Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party has been duly executed and delivered by Originator and constitutes the legally valid, and binding obligation of Originator enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject also to the availability of equitable remedies if equitable remedies are sought. (e) In the event that the Receivables Sale Agreement is held to create a transfer for security purposes rather than a true sale or other outright assignment, the provisions of the Receivables Sale Agreement are effective to create valid security interests in favor of Buyer in all of Originator's right, title and interest in and to the Receivables and Related Security described therein which constitute "accounts," "chattel paper" or "general intangibles" (each as defined in the UCC) (collectively, the "Opinion Collateral"), as security for the payment of a loan deemed to have been made by Buyer to such Originator in an amount equal to the Purchase Price (as defined therein) of the Receivables (as defined therein) acquired from Originator, together with all other obligations of Buyer thereunder. (f) Each of the UCC-1 Financing Statements naming Originator as debtor, Buyer, as secured party, and Administrative Agent, as assignee of secured party to be filed in the Department of Licensing of the State of Washington, is in appropriate form for filing therein. Upon filing of such UCC-1 Financing Statements in such filing offices and payment of the required filing fees, the security interest in favor of Buyer in the Opinion Collateral will be perfected and assigned of record to the Administrative Agent. (g) Based solely on our review of the UCC Search Reports, and assuming (i) the filing of the Financing Statements and payment of the required filing fees in accordance with paragraph (f) and (ii) the absence of any intervening filings between the date and time of the Search Reports and the date and time of the filing of the Financing Statements, the security interest of Buyer in the Opinion Collateral is prior to any security interest granted in the Opinion Collateral by Originator, the priority of which is determined solely by the filing of a financing statement in the Department of Licensing of the State of Washington. (h) To the best of the opinion giver's knowledge, there is no action, suit or other proceeding against Originator or any Affiliate of Originator, which would materially adversely affect the business or financial condition of Originator and its Affiliates taken as a whole or which would materially adversely affect the ability of Originator to perform its obligations under the Receivables Sale Agreement. (i) Originator is not an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 8. A "true sale" opinion and "substantive consolidation" opinion of counsel for Originator with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Receivables Sale Agreement. 9. A Certificate of Originator's chief financial officer certifying that, as of the closing date, no Termination Event or Unmatured Termination Event exists and is continuing. 10. Executed copies of (i) all consents from and authorizations by any Persons and (ii) all waivers and amendments to existing credit facilities, that are necessary in connection with the Receivables Sale Agreement. 11. Executed Subordinated Note by Buyer in favor of Originator. 12. If applicable, a direction letter executed by Originator authorizing Buyer (and the Administrative Agent, as its assignee) and directing warehousemen to allow Buyer (and the Administrative Agent, as its assignee) to inspect and make copies from Originator's books and records maintained at off- site data processing or storage facilities.  The decrease in expense is due primarily to the effect of the change in accounting for engine overhauls discussed above but is offset by an increase in depreciation associated with the additional 767 aircraft placed in service during 2000 and the later part of 1999. In 2000, this expense category also includes an impairment loss of $4.0 million on three DC-8 aircraft which were removed from service.      INTEREST EXPENSE increased in 2000 compared to 1999, primarily as a result of the higher level of average outstanding borrowings. Interest capitalized in 2000 of $6.8 million was primarily related to the acquisition and modification of 767 aircraft and compares to capitalized interest of $4.0 million in 1999 and $5.9 million in 1998. The Company anticipates the level of capitalized interest in 2001 to be less than the amount recorded in 2000 due to fewer 767 aircraft being modified and placed in service.      OTHER income includes gains on sale and realized income from securities held, foreign joint venture earnings and costs associated with accounts receivable securitization transactions. In 2000, a gain of $1.9 million was recorded on the sale of common stock received in connection with the demutualization of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The shares were received since the Company held certain employee benefit policies with Metropolitan. In 1999, a gain of $4.6 million was realized on the sale of 34% of the Company's investment in Equant N.V., an international data network services company. The Company acquired its interest in Equant through its membership in SITA, a cooperative of major airline companies, which primarily provides data communication services to the air transport industry.      INCOME TAXES for 2000 resulted in an effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations of 38.5% compared to 38.1% in 1999 and 38.0% in 1998. The higher tax rates in 2000 were primarily due to higher non- deductible expenses in relation to earnings and higher effective state tax rates.      The Company is undertaking a number of initiatives targeted to improve revenue growth and profitability. In January 2001, the Company announced a new pricing structure for its domestic services that include a rate increase, a shift to zone-based pricing, and a non-scheduled pickup fee. Additionally, a new product, Ground Delivery Service (GDS) is scheduled to be introduced beginning April 2001. This product will leverage the Company's sort and line haul infrastructure and will provide the Company the ability to offer customers both air and ground services. Other initiatives targeted to improve growth include expanded logistics capabilities, e-commerce and marketing alliances, as well as an expansion of the Company's sales force.      The strength of the U.S. and global economies will have an impact on the results of operations in 2001 and beyond. The consensus forecast of some experts indicates very slow U.S. economic growth in the first half of 2001, with growth improving somewhat in the second half of the year. Looking ahead, it is difficult at this point to project a trend for all of 2001 regarding volume growth, but the Company is anticipating modest shipment growth somewhat commensurate with these forecasts. The Company's focus will continue to be on managing yields and cost per shipment to improve margins, while maintaining the high level of customer service.     FINANCIAL CONDITION:           CAPITAL EXPENDITURES and financing associated with those expenditures have been the primary factors affecting the financial condition of the Company over the last three years. A significant portion of these expenditures has been related to the acquisition and modification of aircraft and related flight equipment. Over the past two years the Company accelerated its program to acquire and deploy Boeing 767 aircraft - which provide a high level of operating efficiency compared to the DC-8 aircraft. The Company acquired nine 767 aircraft during 2000. Accordingly, total capital expenditures net of dispositions increased to $368 million in 2000 compared to $293 million in 1999 and $283 million in 1998. At the end of 2000, there were 120 aircraft in service, consisting of 17 767s, 30 DC-8s and 73 DC-9s. In addition, there were two 767 and one DC-9 aircraft in modification status. Other capital expenditures in 2000 included vehicles for expansion and replacement, facilities and package handling equipment, leasehold improvements for new or expanded facilities and computer equipment.      The level of planned capital spending for 2001 has been significantly reduced compared to 2000, primarily as a result of fewer planned aircraft acquisitions. The Company anticipates 2001 capital expenditures of approximately $260 million. This includes aircraft related expenditures of approximately $111 million, including the acquisition of three additional 767 aircraft. Also included is an estimated $30 million for vehicles and facility expansion related to the Ground Delivery Service program being launched in the second quarter. Other expenditures are primarily related to facilities and package handling equipment, leasehold improvements for new or expanded facilities, information systems development and equipment, and replacement vehicles.      As the Company places additional 767 aircraft into service over the next few years, it may continue to remove additional DC-8's from service. This will depend on factors such as overall capacity requirements and the availability of placing aircraft for charter operations. At December 31, 2000 there were five DC-8 aircraft removed from service.      The Company has commitments to acquire a total of 30 767 aircraft including the 19 aircraft owned and the three aircraft which will be delivered in 2001. The remaining 767 aircraft are to be delivered in 2002 and 2003. Additional 767 commitments may be made depending on capacity requirements or for operating efficiency purposes.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:      A majority of the liquidity for financing capital expenditures in the past three years came from internally generated cash provided by operations. Cash provided by operations net of changes in working capital was approximately $264 million in 2000 compared to $259 million in 1999 and $345 million in 1998. Additional liquidity of $150 million was provided in 2000 from advances under a receivable securitization facility implemented in December 2000. Also, the Company's unsecured revolving bank credit agreement has been used as a source of liquidity for periods between other financing transactions.      The Company completed a share repurchase of 1 million shares of common stock in June 2000 for approximately $20.7 million, which were added to the Company's treasury stock. The shares were repurchased pursuant to a 4 million stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in 1998. The Company has no current plans to purchase additional shares under the remaining repurchase authority.      In July 2000, the Company replaced its revolving bank credit facility with a new agreement expiring June 30, 2005. The revolving bank credit is for a total commitment of $275 million, subject to certain financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with covenants at December 31, 2000. One of these covenants requires a fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.75 or greater to be maintained on a prior four quarter reporting basis. The Company's ratio of fixed charge coverage was approximately 2.95 at December 31, 2000. The fixed charge coverage ratio may not be met for the March 31, 2001 reporting date as a result of the decreased level of operating earnings over recent quarters. The Company is pursuing strategies to ensure the borrowing commitment under the bank revolver facility is maintained. These strategies may include obtaining covenant waivers, renegotiating terms of the agreement, and reducing amounts outstanding under the agreement through other financing options available to the Company.      The Company also has available $30 million under unsecured, uncommitted money market lines of credit with two banks, used in conjunction with the revolving credit agreement to facilitate settlement and accommodate short-term borrowing fluctuations.      Reliance on the bank facilities increased during 1999 and 2000 as the result of the level of capital expenditures exceeding cash provided by operating activities. At December 31, 2000, a total of $103.0 million was owed under the revolving bank credit and money market agreements compared to $95.0 million outstanding at December 31, 1999.      In December 2000, the Company completed an agreement for an accounts receivable securitization facility for $200 million with a term of up to three years. This facility is accounted for as a sale of assets. Therefore, the amount outstanding is not reflected as long-term debt on the balance sheet and is not included in the debt capitalization ratio referred to below. At December 31, 2000, the Company had $150 million of sales proceeds drawn and outstanding under the facility.      The Company's percentage ratio of total long-term debt to total capitalization was 24.6% at December 31, 2000, compared to 24.7% at December 31, 1999. Anticipated cash flow from 2001 operations and liquidity available under the accounts receivable securitization facility should provide the majority of the liquidity for projected 2001 capital expenditures. Accordingly, the debt-to-capitalization percentage ratio is not expected to change significantly during 2001.      In management's opinion, the available capacity under the accounts receivable securitization facility and bank credit agreements coupled with anticipated internally generated cash flow from operations should provide adequate flexibility for financing growth in 2001.  INFLATION:      The rate of inflation has been relatively constant over the past several years, and so has the impact of inflation on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The effects of inflation have been considered in management's discussion where considered pertinent.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:      In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers of Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities", which revises standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures, but carries over most of the provisions of SFAS No. 125 without reconsideration. SFAS No. 140 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. SFAS No. 140 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.      In 1998, SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" was issued and requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. SFAS No. 133, as amended, will be implemented in 2001 and is no expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:      Statements contained herein and in other parts of this annual report which are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). Such statements relating to future events involve risks and uncertainties which are inherently difficult to predict, including statements regarding future shipment growth and product acceptance, capacity requirements, capital expenditure levels and the adequacy of available financing capacity. Actual results, however, may vary because of competitor pricing initiatives, customer demand for time-definite and deferred services, the ability of management to successfully implement growth and profitability initiatives, economic and regulatory conditions, fuel price volatility and labor disputes.            AIRBORNE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES        RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING         The management of Airborne, Inc. has the responsibility for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and for their integrity and objectivity. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the management of the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America using management's best estimates and judgment where necessary. Financial information appearing throughout this annual report is consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements.      To help fulfill its responsibility, management maintains a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorizations and are reflected accurately in the Company's records. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that the cost of maintaining a system of internal accounting controls should not exceed benefits expected to be derived from the system. The Company believes that its long-standing emphasis on the highest standards of conduct and ethics set forth in comprehensive written policies serves to reinforce its system of internal controls.      Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors, audited the consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America to independently assess the fair presentation of the Company's financial position results of operations and cash flows.      The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed entirely of outside directors, oversees the fulfillment by management of its responsibilities over financial controls and the preparation of financial statements. The Audit Committee meets with the independent auditors during the year to review audit plans and audit results. This provides the auditors direct access to the Board of Directors.      Management recognizes its responsibility to conduct the business of Airborne, Inc. in accordance with high ethical standards. This responsibility is reflected in key policy statements that, among other things, address potentially conflicting outside business interests of Company employees and specify proper conduct of business activities. Ongoing communications and review programs are designed to help ensure compliance with these policies.                /s/ Robert S. Cline                     /s/ Lanny H. Michael     Robert S.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.      We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.      In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.      As discussed in Note A to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for major engine overhaul costs on DC-9 aircraft effective January 1, 2000.  _/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP_  DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP  February 9, 2001  Seattle, Washington                          IGHT>53,628    68,301      Non-cash financing activities -                  Contribution of treasury stock to profit sharing plans    4,367    --   341      See notes to consolidated financial statements.                        AIRBORNE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  _ Three Years Ended December 31, 2000 _      NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  REORGANIZATION      Effective December 26, 2000, the Company reorganized its corporate structure through the creation of a new holding company, Airborne, Inc. (the Company). Pursuant to a reorganization agreement, Airborne Express, Inc., (formerly Airborne Freight Corporation), ABX Air, Inc., and Sky Courier, Inc. (formerly Airborne Forwarding Corporation) became wholly- owned subsidiaries of Airborne, Inc. Holders of outstanding Airborne Freight Corporation common shares, $1.00 par value, automatically became holders of Airborne, Inc. common shares at the same par value.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS      The Company's revenues are primarily derived from domestic and international transportation of shipments. The Company provides door-to- door express delivery of small packages and documents throughout the United States and to most foreign countries. The Company also acts as an international and domestic freight forwarder for shipments of any size. Most domestic shipments are transported on the Company's own airline and a fleet of ground transportation vehicles through its Company-owned airport and central sorting facilities, or one of nine regional hubs. International shipments are transported utilizing a combination of the Company's domestic network, commercial airline lift capacity, and through a network of offshore Company offices and independent agents.      As of December 31, 2000, the Company had approximately 10,600 employees (44% of total employees), including approximately 800 pilots, employed under collective bargaining agreements with various locals of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Warehousemen. The pilots are covered by an agreement that becomes amendable on July 31, 2001. Most labor agreements covering the Company's ground personnel expire in either 2003 or 2004. The Company has not experienced any significant disruptions from labor disputes in the past.  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION      The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  USE OF ESTIMATES      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the financial statements.  CASH      The Company has a cash management system under which a cash overdraft exists for uncleared checks in the Company's primary disbursement accounts. The cash amount in the accompanying financial statements represents balances in other accounts prior to being transferred to the primary disbursement accounts. Uncleared checks of $51,738,000 and $43,246,000 are included in accounts payable at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  SPARE PARTS AND FUEL INVENTORY      Spare parts are stated at average cost and fuel inventory is stated at cost on a first-in, first-out basis.  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT      Property and equipment is stated at cost. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment disposed of are removed from the accounts with any related gain or loss reflected in earnings from operations.  For financial reporting purposes, depreciation of property and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the asset's useful life or lease term as follows:                Flight equipment                                    5 to 18 years     Buildings, runways, and leasehold improvements      5 to 40 years     Package handling and ground support equipment       3 to 10 years     Vehicles and other equipment                        3 to  8 years           DC-8 and DC-9 aircraft generally carry residual values of 10% and 15% of asset cost, respectively. All other property and equipment have no assigned residual values.      As of December 31, 2000, residual values on three DC-8 aircraft that were removed from service were adjusted to fair value in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of". During 2000, an impairment loss of $3,956,000 was recorded and included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of net earnings. The fair values of the aircraft were adjusted to their estimated parts value. The fair value approximated net book value on two additional DC-8 aircraft which had been removed from service as of December 31, 2000.      Major engine overhauls as well as ordinary engine maintenance and repairs for DC-8 and 767 aircraft are performed by third-party service providers under long-term contracts. Service costs under the contracts are based upon hourly rates for engine usage and are charged to expense in the period utilization occurs. Beginning in 2000, major engine overhauls for DC- 9 aircraft are expensed as incurred. As discussed in "Change in Accounting" below, prior to 2000 the Company provided accruals for costs in advance of the next scheduled overhaul. The provision for engine overhauls was included in depreciation and amortization expense in prior years.  CAPITALIZED INTEREST      Interest incurred during the construction period of certain facilities and on aircraft purchase and modification costs is capitalized until the date the asset is placed in service as an additional cost of the asset. Capitalized interest was $6,770,000, $3,969,000 and $5,850,000 for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  INCOME TAXES      The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the timing of reporting certain revenues and expenses for financial versus tax purposes. Deferred taxes are measured using provisions of currently enacted tax laws. Tax credits are accounted for as a reduction of income taxes in the year in which the credit originates.  FUEL CONTRACTS      The Company has, in the past, utilized fuel contract hedges with financial institutions to limit its exposure to volatility in jet fuel prices. Under terms of the contracts, the Company either made or received payments if the market price of heating oil, as determined by an index of the monthly NYMEX Heating Oil futures contracts, was lower than or exceeded certain prices agreed to between the Company and the financial institutions. Settlements were made in cash and recorded in the period of settlement as either an increase or decrease to fuel expense.      The Company had no fuel contract hedges outstanding at December 31, 2000. There were no settlement payments made on fuel contract hedges during 2000. Settlement payments of $1,886,000 and $7,915,000 were made during 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company may enter into fuel contract hedges in future periods depending on pricing and market conditions.      The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". As amended by SFAS No. 137, this statement will be effective for fiscal year 2001. SFAS No. 138, an additional amendment, and SFAS No. 133 require an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value.      Under the cash flow hedge provisions of SFAS Nos. 133 and 138, the Company will be required to record all outstanding fuel contracts at fair value, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded as a component of Other Comprehensive Income if the hedges are determined to be effective. Upon implementation in 2001, the Company does not anticipate the provisions of SFAS Nos. 133 and 138 will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME      Comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income which includes changes in equity arising during the period from holding investments in marketable securities and foreign joint ventures.  REVENUE RECOGNITION      Domestic revenues and most domestic operating expenses are recognized when shipments are picked up from the customer. International revenues and direct air carrier expenses are recognized in the period when shipments are tendered to a carrier for transport to a foreign destination. Domestic and international delivery costs are recognized in the period incurred. The net revenue resulting from existing recognition policies does not materially differ from that which would be recognized on a delivery date basis.  CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING      Effective January 1, 2000, the Company changed its method of accounting for major engine overhaul costs on DC-9 aircraft from the accrual method to the direct expense method where costs are expensed as incurred. Previously, these costs were accrued in advance of the next scheduled overhaul based upon engine usage and estimates of overhaul costs. The Company believes that this new method is preferable because it is more consistent with industry practice and appropriate given the relatively large size of its DC-9 fleet.      The cumulative effect of this change in accounting resulted in a non- cash credit in 2000 of $14,206,000 net of taxes, or $.29 per diluted share. Excluding the cumulative effect, this change increased net earnings for 2000 by approximately $3,687,000, net of tax or $.08 per diluted share. If the accounting change had been retroactively applied, net earnings and earnings per diluted share would have been as follows (in thousands except per share data):                Year Ended December 31                                1999         1998                                                           ----         ----     As reported:          Net Earnings                                   $91,201     $ 137,285          Earnings per diluted share                     $  1.85     $    2.72          Proforma:          Net Earnings                                   $94,828     $ 135,819          Earnings per diluted share                     $  1.92     $    2.69       RECLASSIFICATIONS      Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the classification used in 2000.       NOTE B - FAIR VALUE INFORMATION  The carrying amounts and related fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as follows (in thousands):                December 31                             2000                  1999     - -----------                             ----                  ----                                     Carrying       Fair   Carrying       Fair                                       Amount      Value     Amount      Value                                       ------      -----     ------      -----     Marketable securities           $ 18,747   $ 18,747   $ 19,619   $ 19,619     Long-term debt                   322,707    306,078    315,149    314,804           Marketable securities consist primarily of commingled investment funds that may be used for funding non-qualified pension plan obligations. These securities are considered available-for-sale securities for financial reporting purposes and are classified with equipment deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Fair value for these investments is based on quoted market prices for the securities underlying the investment funds or the same securities. Unrealized losses on these securities, which are included in other comprehensive income, were $1,248,000 for 2000. Unrealized gains on these securities were $47,000 and $1,540,000 for 1999 and 1998, respectively. Realized gains recognized in 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $1,117,000, $1,268,000 and $1,531,000, respectively.      Discussion regarding the fair value of the Company's long-term debt and fuel contracts is disclosed in the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements. Carrying amounts for cash, trade accounts receivable and current liabilities approximate fair value.       NOTE C - ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  Accounts receivable consist of the following (in thousands):                December 31                                            2000         1999                                                            ----         ----     Retained interest in securitized accounts     receivable:          Securitized trade accounts receivable          $340,838     $      -     Less: Proceeds from sale of undivided interest in     receivables                                         (150,000)           -     Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts                 (8,610)           -                                                         --------     --------          Retained interest in securitized accounts     receivable, net                                      182,228            -          Other accounts receivable:          Other trade accounts receivable                  38,137      348,684     Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts                 (1,680)      (9,640)                                                         --------     --------     Other trade accounts receivable, net                  36,457      339,044                                                         --------     --------     Accounts receivable on consolidated balance sheets  $218,685     $339,044           The Company entered into an agreement with a financial institution in December 2000 to finance the sale, on a continuous basis, of an undivided interest in all eligible U.S. trade accounts receivables through an accounts receivable securitization facility. This financing agreement is accounted for as a sale of assets under the provisions of SFAS No. 125, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities".      To facilitate the sales, the Company formed Airborne Credit, Inc. ("ACI"), a wholly-owned, special purpose, bankruptcy remote subsidiary consolidated by the Company. The Company transfers substantially all of its U.S. trade account receivables to ACI, who's sole purpose, in turn, is to sell an undivided interest in the receivables to an unrelated third party and receive proceeds of up to $200,000,000. The facility has a committed term of three years, subject to annual renewal of a separate liquidity facility. The Company retains the servicing of the receivables transferred to ACI.      To the extent that customers default on the receivables, losses will first reduce the Company's retained interest in the receivables prior to reducing the interests sold through the facility. Any increase in actual defaults above the recorded amount of allowance for doubtful accounts would decrease the value of the Company's retained interest.      Upon the sale of the undivided interest in the receivables, the Company incurs a liability to fund the purchaser's costs of financing the proceeds. This liability is recorded at the time of sale and is estimated based on projected financing costs over the projected life of the receivable interests sold. Discounts associated with the sale of receivables, primarily related to recording the obligation to fund the purchaser's costs, were $96,000 for 2000 and are included in other expense in the consolidated statements of net earnings. The Company does not believe any difference between the projected and actual financing costs would have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations.      In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities", which revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures but carries over most of the provisions of SFAS No. 125 without reconsideration. SFAS No. 140 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. SFAS No. 140 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or its results of operations.

The agreement expires June 30, 2005. Interest rates for borrowings outstanding are generally determined by maturities selected and prevailing market conditions. The Company was in compliance with covenants of the revolving credit agreement during 2000, 1999 and 1998, including net worth restrictions that limit the payment of dividends ($142,173,000 of retained earnings was not restricted at December 31, 2000). One of the covenants requires a fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.75 or greater to be maintained on a prior four quarter reporting basis. The Company's ratio of fixed charge coverage was approximately 2.95 at December 31, 2000. The fixed charge coverage ratio may not be met for the March 31, 2001 reporting date as a result of the decreased level of operating earnings over recent quarters. The Company is pursuing strategies to ensure the borrowing commitment under the bank revolver facility is maintained. These strategies may include obtaining covenant waivers, renegotiating terms of the agreement, and reducing amounts outstanding under the agreement through other financing options available to the Company.      The Company has available $30,000,000 of financing under uncommitted money market lines of credit with several banks. These facilities bear interest at rates that vary with the banks' cost of funds and are typically less than the prevailing bank prime rate. The average interest rate on these borrowings was 7.05% for 2000. These credit lines are used in conjunction with the revolving credit agreement to facilitate settlement and accommodate short-term borrowing fluctuations.      The Company classified the borrowings outstanding under the money market lines of credit as long-term as of December 31, 2000. The Company had the intent and ability at that date to refinance these borrowings under the revolving credit agreement.      The Company's tax-exempt airport facilities refunding bonds carry no sinking fund requirements and bear interest at weekly adjustable rates. The average interest rate on these borrowings was 4.2% during 2000. Payment of principal and interest is secured by an irrevocable bank letter of credit that is collateralized by a mortgage on certain airport properties which had a net carrying value of $46,343,000 at December 31, 2000.      The scheduled annual principal payments on long-term debt for the next five years are $477,000, $100,513,000, $553,000, $596,000 and $203,643,000 for 2001 through 2005, respectively.      The fair value information shown in Note B reflects values for the Company's senior notes based on quoted market prices for the same issues. The carrying value of the Company's remaining long-term financial debt instruments approximates fair value primarily because of the repricing frequency of the instruments.     NOTE H - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES      OPERATING LEASES      The Company is obligated under various long-term operating lease agreements for certain equipment and for a substantial portion of its facilities. These leases expire at various dates through 2016. Rental expense for 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $95,559,000, $98,416,000 and $104,816,000, respectively.  Rental commitments under long-term operating leases at December 31, 2000 total $415,936,000 and are payable as follows (in thousands):                                                                   Facilities    Equipment                                                        ----------    ---------     2001                                                 $ 76,350       $3,167     2002                                                   73,395        2,932     2003                                                   61,176        1,785     2004                                                   51,304          613     2005                                                   38,139           31     2006 and beyond                                       107,044            -       COMMITMENTS      The Company has entered into firm agreements to purchase 11 used Boeing 767s and related freighter conversion kits at various dates through 2003. At December 31, 2000, cash deposits of $2,743,000 had been made toward these purchases. Additional deposits and payments for all aircraft acquisitions will approximate $67,321,000, $85,243,000 and $75,400,000 for 2001 through 2003, respectively. There are currently no aircraft related commitments extending beyond 2003.  CONTINGENCIES      In the normal course of business, the Company has various legal claims and other contingent matters outstanding. Management believes that any ultimate liability arising from these actions would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2000.     NOTE I - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS           The Company sponsors defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and postretirement healthcare plans.

Retirement income has historically been provided to employees through the coordination of benefits accumulated and funded through a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution profit sharing plan. Generally, benefit levels calculated under defined benefit plan formulas are offset by amounts contributed and earned in an employee's profit sharing account. The amendments adopted in 2000 provided for an increase in retirement income levels provided under the defined benefit plan through formula changes that increased the percentage applied to an employee's salary to determine the level of retirement benefit and removed provisions that limited the maximum years of allowable service credit. These changes are effective for past and future years of accumulated service with the Company. Additionally, the Company amended its defined contribution profit sharing plan to discontinue future contributions to employee's accounts. Previous contributions and earnings accumulated under the profit sharing plan prior to the amendments as well as future account earnings will continue to be coordinated with benefits accrued under the defined benefit plan.      The effect of the amendments is to increase pension expense and projected benefit obligations provided under the defined benefit plans and discontinue contributions to the profit sharing plan, other than for the Company's pilots. The Company's funding policy provides for annual contributions to pension trusts at least equal to amounts required by ERISA.      The Company's qualified defined benefit pension plans had aggregate accumulated benefit obligations of $106,863,000 compared to plan assets of $102,567,000. All qualified defined benefit plans had plan assets in excess of accumulated benefit obligations as of December 31, 1999.      The Company also sponsors several non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The accumulated benefit obligation of these plans was $18,379,000 and $13,811,000 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Postretirement liabilities include accruals relating to these plans of $16,039,000 and $14,611,000 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company has invested in certain commingled investment funds that may be used for funding non-qualified pension plan obligations.      The assumed healthcare cost trend rate used in measuring postretirement healthcare benefit costs was 8.5% for 2000, decreasing each year to a 5.5% annual growth rate in 2003 and thereafter. A 1% increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate for each year would not have a material effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or cost as of or for the year ended December 31, 2000. Postretirement healthcare plan obligations have not been funded.      The Company maintains defined contribution capital accumulation and profit sharing plans. Capital accumulation plans (401K) are funded by both voluntary employee salary deferrals of up to 16% of annual compensation and by employer matching contributions on employee salary deferrals of up to 6% of annual compensation. In connection with the amendments to the Company's qualified defined benefit retirement plans, except for the pilots, accruals for contributions to the profit sharing plans were discontinued beginning in 2000. Prior to 2000, a basic formula had been followed for contributions of 7% of earnings before taxes up to a specific profit level plus 14% of earnings in excess of that level. The profit sharing plans hold 1,166,725 shares of the Company's common stock at December 31, 2000, representing 2% of outstanding shares.

Two of these plans, approved by the shareholders in 1994 and 1998 (the "1994 Plan" and "1998 Plan"), reserve shares of the Company's common stock for issuance to officers and key employees. Options granted under the 1994 Plan vest over a three year period. Options granted under the 1998 Plan include options which vest over a four year period and performance options issued to the Company's executive officers which vest upon attainment of specified market price targets of the Company's common stock. A third plan, the 2000 Directors' Stock Option Plan, provides for annual grants to the Company's non-employee directors of 2,000 shares that vest fully on the date of grant. Options granted under these three plans are issued at the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. A total of 7,707,250 shares may be granted under these plans. There were 4,086,575 shares available for future grants as of December 31, 2000.

NOTE L - SEGMENT INFORMATION           The Company has organized its business into two reportable operating segments. The domestic segment derives its revenues from the door-to-door delivery of small packages and documents throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Domestic operations are supported principally by Company operated aircraft and facilities. The international segment derives its revenues from express door-to-door delivery and a variety of freight services. International revenues are recognized on shipments where the origin and/or destination is outside of locations supported by the domestic segment. The Company uses a variable cost approach in delivering international services through use of existing commercial airline capacity in connection with its domestic network and independent express and freight agents in locations not currently served by Company-owned foreign operations.  The following is a summary of key segment information (in thousands):                                                     Domestic    International      Total                                          --------    -------------      -----     2000     - ----     Revenues                           $2,895,818     $  380,132     $3,275,950     Depreciation and amortization         204,913          1,493        206,406     Segment earnings from operations       49,915         (7,297)        42,618     Segment assets                      1,661,075         84,844      1,745,919     Expenditures for property        and equipment                      370,317          2,258        372,575          1999     - ----     Revenues                           $2,772,782     $  366,342     $3,139,124     Depreciation and amortization         207,902          1,488        209,390     Segment earnings from operations      156,637          1,084        157,721     Segment assets                      1,569,367         73,883      1,643,250     Expenditures for property        and equipment                      292,130          2,189        294,319          1998     - ----     Revenues                           $2,712,344     $  361,440     $3,073,784     Depreciation and amortization         183,147          1,379        184,526     Segment earnings from operations      230,831          1,501        232,332     Segment assets                      1,428,956         72,621      1,501,577     Expenditures for property        and equipment                      281,571          3,910        285,481           International operations are supported in the United States by pickup and delivery, customer service and airline capabilities provided by the domestic segment. Management allocates these costs, generally on a per shipment basis, to the international segment.      Management considers interest expense, other income and income taxes as corporate items and, accordingly, does not allocate these amounts to the operating segments. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.      A substantial portion of international revenue is associated with shipments originating within the United States ($211,835,000 in 2000, $234,087,000 in 1999 and $256,259,000 in 1998). Long lived assets located within the United States and associated with the international segment were $6,382,000, $6,792,000 and $6,274,000 as of December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.     NOTE M - GAIN ON SALE OF SECURITIES           In June 2000, a gain of $1,912,000 was recorded from the sale of common shares of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("Metropolitan"). As a policyholder for certain employee benefit programs, these shares were allocated to the Company and sold in connection with the demutualization of Metropolitan. The gain was recorded in other income on the consolidated statements of net earnings.      The Company is a participating member of SITA, a cooperative of major airline companies, which primarily provides data communication services to the air transport industry. Through this membership the Company holds depository certificates in The SITA Foundation ("Foundation") whose principal asset is an equity interest in Equant, N.V. ("Equant"), an international data network services company whose stock is traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ENT. In December 1999, the Foundation sold a portion of its interest in Equant through a public offering and distributed proceeds pro rata to the certificate holders that elected to participate in the offering. As part of this sale, the Company sold 34% of its interest in Equant and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $4,600,000 that was included in other income on the consolidated statements of net earnings.      The Company has remaining restricted depository certificates in the Foundation that may, in the future, become convertible into 103,351 shares of Equant. As convertibility is contingent on future share offerings by the Foundation, no amount has been recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2000 and 1999. The Company has no cost basis in the depository certificates, although the converted fair value of the remaining certificates was approximately $2,700,000 and $11,600,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATION          In connection with the issuance of $200,000,000 of Senior Notes (Notes) by Airborne Express, Inc. (AEI), certain subsidiaries (collectively, "Guarantors") of Airborne, Inc. (the "Company")have fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, the obligations to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes. The Guarantors are ABX Air Inc. (ABX) and Sky Courier, Inc. (SKY), which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and Airborne FTZ Inc. (FTZ) and Wilmington Air Park Inc. (WAP), which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of ABX.      ABX is a certificated air carrier that owns and operates the domestic express cargo services for which AEI is the sole customer. ABX also offers air charter services on a limited basis to third-party customers. FTZ owns certain aircraft parts inventories that it sells primarily to ABX but also has limited sales to third-party customers. FTZ is also the holder of a foreign trade zone certificate at Wilmington airport property.
