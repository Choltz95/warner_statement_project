AIRBORNE FREIGHT CORPORATION 1995 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT Table of Contents PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS - ------------------- a) General Development of Business -------------------------------- Airborne Freight Corporation (herein referred to as "Airborne Express" or the "Company", which reference shall include its subsidiaries and their assets and operations, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise) was incorporated in Delaware on May 10, 1968. The Company is an air express company and air freight forwarder that expedites shipments of all sizes to destinations throughout the United States and most foreign countries. The Company holds a certificate of registration issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the service mark AIRBORNE EXPRESS. Most public presentation of the Company carries this name. The purpose of using this trade name is to more clearly communicate to the market place the primary nature of the business of the Company. ABX Air, Inc., the Company's principal wholly-owned subsidiary (herein referred to as "ABX"), was incorporated in Delaware on January 22, 1980. ABX provides domestic express cargo service and cargo service to Canada. The Company is the sole customer of ABX for this service. ABX also offers limited charter service. b) Financial Information about Industry Segments ---------------------------------------------- None c) Narrative Description of Business ---------------------------------- Airborne Express provides door- to-door express delivery of small packages and documents throughout the United States and to and from most foreign countries. The Company also acts as an international and domestic freight forwarder for shipments of any size. The Company's strategy is to be the low cost provider of express services for high volume corporate customers. Domestic Operations - -------------------- The Company's domestic operations, supported by approximately 265 facilities, primarily involve express door-to-door delivery of shipments weighing less than 100 pounds. Shipments consist primarily of business documents and other printed matter, electronic and computer parts, software, machine parts, health care items, films and videotapes, and other items for which speed and reliability of delivery are important. The Company's primary service is its overnight express product. This product, which comprised approximately 58% of the Company's domestic shipments during 1995, generally provides for before noon delivery on the next business day to most metropolitan cities in the United States. The Company also provides Saturday and holiday pickup and delivery service for most cities. During the last five years, the Company has also offered a deferred service product, Select Delivery Service ("SDS"), which provided for next page 1 afternoon or second day delivery. SDS service shipments weighing five pounds or less were delivered on a next afternoon basis with shipments weighing more than five pounds delivered on a second day basis. SDS shipments, which comprised approximately 42% of total domestic shipments during 1995, are lower priced than the overnight express product reflecting the less time sensitive nature of the shipments. In early 1996, the Company began phasing in two new levels of deferred service to replace its SDS product. The services, Next Afternoon Service and Second Day Service, will expand the Company's deferred service options. Next Afternoon Service will be available for shipments weighing five pounds or less and Second Day Service will be offered for shipments of all weights. Next Afternoon Service rates will be higher than Second Day Service rates. While the Company's domestic airline system is designed primarily to handle express shipments, any available capacity is also utilized to carry shipments which the Company would normally move on other carriers in its role as an air freight forwarder. Communications System - ---------------------- FOCUS (Freight On-line Control and Update System) is a proprietary communications system which provides real time information for purposes of tracking and providing the status of customer's shipments as well as monitoring the performance of the Company's operational systems. The Company's facilities and international agents are linked to FOCUS and provide inputs to the system, in part through the driver's use of hand-held scanners which read bar-codes on the shipping documents, with information necessary to determine the status and location of customer shipments 24 hours a day. FOCUS also allows for direct customer access to shipment information through the use of their own computer systems. FOCUS also provides the Company's personnel with important information for use in coordinating its operational activities. Information regarding Company- operated aircraft arrivals and departures, weather, and documentation requirements for shipments destined to foreign locations are several examples of the information maintained by FOCUS. Pickup and Delivery - -------------------- The Company accomplishes its door-to-door pickup and delivery service using approximately 12,800 radio-dispatched delivery vans and trucks, of which approximately 4,500 are owned by the Company. Independent contractors under contract with the Company provide the balance of the pickup and delivery services. Because convenience is an important factor in attracting business from less frequent shippers, the Company has an ongoing program to place drop boxes in convenient locations. The Company has approximately 9,800 boxes in service. page 2 Sort Facilities - ---------------- The Company's main sort center is located in Wilmington, Ohio. As express delivery volume has increased, the main sort center has been expanded. In 1995, the sort center was expanded and currently has the capacity to handle approximately 980,000 pieces during the primary 2-1/2 hour nightly sort operation. On average, approximately 835,000 pieces were sorted each weekday night at the sort center during the fourth quarter of 1995. In addition to the sort facilities, the Wilmington location consists of a Company-owned airport which includes maintenance, storage, training and refueling facilities; and operations and administrative offices. The Company also conducts a day sort operation at Wilmington. The day sort serviced SDS shipments weighing in excess of five pounds that are consolidated at certain regional hub facilities and either flown or trucked into or out of Wilmington. Beginning in 1996, the Company plans to have the day sort handle shipments weighing five pounds or less that are designated for Second Day Service. The operation of the Wilmington facility is critical to the Company's business. The inability to use the Wilmington airport, because of bad weather or other factors, would have a serious adverse effect on the Company's service. However, contingency plans, including landing at nearby airports and transporting packages to and from the sort center by truck, can be implemented to address temporary inaccessibility of the Wilmington airport. In addition to the main sort facility at Wilmington, ten regional hub facilities have been established primarily to sort shipments originating and having a destination within approximately a 300 mile radius of a regional hub. In the fourth quarter of 1995, approximately 59% and 16% of total shipment weight was handled through the night sort and day sort operations at Wilmington, respectively, with the remaining 25% being handled exclusively by the regional hubs. Shipment Routing - ----------------- The logistical means of moving a shipment from its origin to destination are determined by several factors. Shipments are routed differently depending on shipment product type, weight, geographic distances between origin and destination, and locations of Company stations relative to the locations of sort facilities. Shipments generally are moved between stations and sort facilities on either Company aircraft or contracted trucks. A limited number of shipments are transported airport- to- airport on commercial air carriers. Overnight express shipments and deferred service shipments weighing five pounds or less are picked up by local stations and generally consolidated with other stations' shipments at Company airport facilities. Shipments that are not serviced through regional hubs are loaded on Company aircraft departing each weekday evening from various points within the United States and Canada. These aircraft may stop at other airports to permit additional locations and feeder aircraft to consolidate their cargo onto the larger aircraft before completing the flight to the Wilmington hub. The aircraft are scheduled to arrive at Wilmington between approximately 11:30 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. at which page 3 time the shipments are sorted and reloaded. The aircraft are scheduled to depart before 6:00 a.m. and return to their applicable destinations in time to complete scheduled next business morning or deferred service commitments. The Wilmington hub also receives shipments via truck from selected stations in the vicinity of the Wilmington hub for integration with the nightly sort process. For the day sort operation, generally eight aircraft return to Wilmington from overnight service destinations on Tuesday through Thursday. These aircraft, and trucks from six regional hubs, arrive at Wilmington between 10:00 a.m. and noon, at which time shipments are sorted and reloaded on the aircraft or trucks by 3:00 p.m. for departure and return to their respective destinations. The Company also performs weekend sort operations at Wilmington to accommodate Saturday pickups and Monday deliveries of both overnight express and deferred service shipments. This sort is supported by 13 Company aircraft and by trucks. Aircraft - --------- The Company currently utilizes used aircraft manufactured in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Upon acquisition, the aircraft are substantially modified by the Company. At the end of 1995, the Company's in- service fleet consisted of a total of 105 aircraft, including 33 McDonnell Douglas DC-8s (consisting of 11 series 61, 6 series 62 and 16 series 63), 61 DC-9s (consisting of 2 series 10, 41 series 30 and 18 series 40), and 11 YS-11 turboprop aircraft. The Company owns the majority of the aircraft it operates, but has completed sale-leaseback transactions with respect to six DC-8 and six DC-9 aircraft. In addition, approximately 70 smaller aircraft are chartered nightly to connect small cities with Company aircraft that then operate to and from Wilmington. In December 1995, the Company announced an agreement to purchase 12 used Boeing 767-200's between the years 1997 and 2000 and its plans to pursue the acquisition of 10 to 15 additional used 767-200's between the years 2000 and 2004. This newer generation of aircraft should increase operating efficiency and allow the Company to meet anticipated demand for additional lift capacity. There are no plans to retire any aircraft as a result of the acquisitions. At year end 1995, the nightly lift capacity of the system was about 3.5 million pounds versus approximately 3.1 million pounds and 2.8 million pounds at the end of 1994 and 1993, respectively. Over the past several years the Company's utilization of available lift capacity has exceeded 80%. In response to increased public awareness regarding the operation of older aircraft, the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") periodically mandates additional maintenance requirements for certain aircraft, including the type operated by the Company. In 1995, the Company completed a significant inspection and maintenance program pertaining to corrosion as required by an Airworthiness Directive issued by the FAA. The FAA could, in the future, impose additional maintenance requirements for aircraft and engines of the type operated by the Company or interpret existing rules in a manner which could have a material effect on the Company's operations and financial position. page 4 In accordance with federal law and FAA regulations, only subsonic turbojet aircraft classified as Stage 2 or 3 by the FAA may be operated in the United States. Generally, Stage 3 aircraft produce less noise than a comparable Stage 2 aircraft. In 1990, Congress passed the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (the "Noise Act"). Among other things, the Noise Act generally requires turbojet aircraft weighing in excess of 75,000 pounds and operating in the United States (the type of DC-8 and DC-9 aircraft operated by the Company) to comply with Stage 3 noise emission standards on or before December 31, 1999. The Company's YS-11 turboprop aircraft are not subject to these requirements. In accordance with the Noise Act, the FAA has issued regulations establishing interim compliance deadlines. These rules require air carriers to reduce the base level of Stage 2 aircraft they operate 50% by December 31, 1996; and 75% by December 31, 1998. As of December 31, 1995 the Company had reduced the base level of its Stage 2 aircraft by approximately 41% and expects to meet or exceed the compliance percentage at the interim compliance deadline of December 31, 1996. As of December 31, 1995, 49 of the Company's turbojet aircraft (23 DC-8 and 26 DC-9 aircraft) were Stage 3 aircraft, the balance being Stage 2 aircraft. In addition to FAA regulation, certain local airports also regulate noise compliance. See "Business - Regulation". The Company, in conjunction with several other companies, has developed noise suppression technology known as hush kits for its DC-9 series aircraft which have been certified to meet FAA Stage 3 requirements. Stage 3 requirements have been met on 26 DC-9 series aircraft. The capital cost for Stage 3 hush kits is approximately $1.2 million for each DC-9 series aircraft. The Company has installed hush kits which satisfy Stage 3 compliance requirements on all of its DC-8-62 and DC-8-63 series aircraft and one of its DC-8-61 series aircraft. The estimated capital cost for these hush kits and related hardware on the DC-8-62 and 63 series aircraft is approximately $1.6 million per aircraft. The capital cost to modify the DC-8-61 aircraft to meet Stage 3 noise standards is approximately $4.0 million per aircraft. International Operations - ------------------------- The Company provides international express door-to-door delivery and a variety of freight services. These services are provided in most foreign countries on an inbound and outbound basis through a network of Airborne offices and independent agents. Most international deliveries are accomplished within 24 to 96 hours of pickup. The Company's domestic stations are staffed and equipped to handle international shipments to or from almost anywhere in the world. In addition to its extensive domestic network, the Company operates its own offices in the Far East, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The Company's freight and express agents worldwide are connected to FOCUS, Airborne's on- line communication network, through which the Company can provide its customers with immediate access to the status of shipments almost anywhere in the world. The Company's international air express service is intended for the movement of non dutiable and certain dutiable shipments weighing less than 99 pounds. The Company's international air freight service handles heavier page 5 weight shipments on either an airport-to-airport, door-to-airport or door- to- door basis. The Company also offers ocean service capabilities for customers who want a lower cost shipping option. The Company's strategy is to use a variable-cost approach in delivering and expanding international services to its customers. This strategy uses existing commercial airline lift capacity in connection with the Company's domestic network to move shipments to and from overseas destinations and origins. Additionally, service arrangements with independent freight and express agents have been entered into to accommodate shipments in locations not currently served by Company-owned operations. The Company currently believes there are no significant service advantages which would justify the operation of its own aircraft on international routes, or making significant investment in additional offshore facilities or ground operations. In order to expand its business at a reasonable cost, the Company continues to explore possible joint venture agreements, similar to its arrangement with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. in Japan, which combine the Company's management expertise, domestic express system and information systems with local business knowledge and market reputation of suitable partners. Customers and Marketing - ------------------------ The Company's primary domestic strategy focuses on express services for high volume corporate customers. Most high volume customers have entered into service agreements providing for specified rates or rate schedules for express deliveries. As of December 31, 1995, the Company serviced approximately 430,000 active customer shipping locations. The Company determines prices for any particular domestic express customer based on competitive factors, anticipated costs, shipment volume and weight, and other considerations. The Company believes that it generally offers prices that are competitive with, or lower than, prices quoted by its principal competitors for comparable services. Internationally, the Company's marketing strategy is to target the outbound express and freight shipments of U.S. corporate customers, and to sell the inbound service of the Company's distribution capabilities in the United States. Both in the international and domestic markets, the Company believes that its customers are most effectively reached by a direct sales force, and accordingly, does not currently engage in mass media advertising. Domestic sales representatives are responsible for selling both domestic and international express shipments. In addition, the International Division has its own dedicated direct sales organization for selling international freight service. The Company's sales force currently consists of approximately 300 domestic representatives and approximately 70 international specialists. The Company's sales efforts are supported by the Marketing and International Divisions, based at the Company headquarters. Senior management is also active in marketing the Company's services to major accounts. page 6 Value-added services continue to be important factors in attracting and retaining customers. Accordingly, the Company is automating more of its operations to make the service easier for customers to use and to provide them with valuable management information. The Company believes that it is generally competitive with other express carriers in terms of reliability, value-added services and convenience. For many of its high volume customers, the Company offers a metering device, called LIBRA II, which is installed at the customer's place of business. With minimum data entry, the metering device weighs the package, calculates the shipping charges, generates the shipping labels and provides a daily shipping report. At year end 1995, the system was in use at approximately 8,200 domestic customer locations and 700 international customer locations. Use of LIBRA II not only benefits the customer directly, but also lowers the Company's operating costs, since LIBRA II shipment data is transferred into the Airborne FOCUS shipment tracking system automatically, thus avoiding duplicate data entry. "Customer Linkage", an electronic data interchange ("EDI") program developed for Airborne's highest volume shippers, allows customers, with their computers, to create shipping documentation at the same time they are entering orders for their goods. At the end of each day, shipping activities are transmitted electronically to the Airborne FOCUS system where information is captured for shipment tracking and billing purposes. Customer Linkage benefits the customer by eliminating repetitive data entry and paperwork and also lowers the Company's operating costs by eliminating manual data entry. EDI also includes electronic invoicing and payment remittance processing. The Company also has available a software program known as Quicklink, which significantly reduces programming time required by customers to take advantage of linkage benefits. In 1995, the Company unveiled "LIGHTSHIP-TRACKER", a PC-based tracking software, which is the first in a series of planned new software products designed to improve customer productivity and provide convenient access to the Company's various services. LIGHTSHIP-TRACKER allows customers, working from their PCs, to view the status of and receive information regarding their shipments through access to the Airborne FOCUS system. The Company offers a number of special logistics programs to customers through its Advanced Logistics Services Corp. ("ALS") subsidiary. This subsidiary operates the Company's Stock Exchange and Hub Warehousing and other logistics programs. These programs provide customers the ability to maintain inventories which can be managed either by Company or customer personnel. Items inventoried at Wilmington can be delivered utilizing either the Company's airline system or, if required, commercial airlines on a next-flight-out basis. ALS' Central Print program allows information to be sent electronically to customer computers located at Wilmington where Company personnel monitor printed output and ship the material according to customer instructions. In addition, the Company's Sky Courier business provides expedited next-plane-out service at premium prices. Sky Courier also offers a Regional Warehousing program where customer inventories are managed at any of over 60 locations around the United States and Canada. page 7 The Company has obtained ISO 9000 certification for its Chicago, Philadelphia and London stations and its Seattle Headquarters. ISO 9000 is a program developed by the International Standards Organization ("ISO"), based in Geneva, Switzerland. This organization provides a set of international standards on quality management and quality assurance presently recognized in 92 countries. The certification is an asset in doing business worldwide and provides evidence of the Company's commitment to excellence and quality. Competition - ------------ The market for the Company's services has been and is expected to remain highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in both domestic and international markets are price, the ability to provide reliable pickup and delivery, and value-added services. Federal Express continues to be the dominant competitor in the domestic express business, followed by United Parcel Service. Airborne Express ranks third in shipment volume behind these two companies in the domestic express business. Other domestic express competitors include the U.S. Postal Service's Express Mail Service and several other transportation companies offering next morning or next-plane-out delivery service. The Company also competes to some extent with companies offering ground transportation services and with facsimile and other forms of electronic transmission. The Company believes it is important to maintain an active capital expansion program to increase capacity, improve service and increase productivity as its volume of shipments increases. However, the Company has significantly less capital resources than its two primary competitors. In the international markets, in addition to Federal Express and United Parcel Service, the Company competes with DHL, TNT and other air freight forwarders or carriers and most commercial airlines. Employees - ---------- As of December 31, 1995, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 11,500 full-time employees and 8,000 part-time and casual employees. Approximately 5,400 full-time employees (including the Company's 660 pilots) and 3,400 part-time and casual employees are employed under union contracts, primarily with locals of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Warehousemen. Labor Agreements - ----------------- Most labor agreements covering the Company's ground personnel were recently renegotiated for four-year terms expiring in 1998. The Company's pilots are covered by a contract which became amendable on July 31, 1995. Negotiations with the pilots are ongoing and the Company believes the contract will be amended without experiencing any work disruption. page 8 Subsidiaries - ------------- The Company has the following wholly-owned subsidiaries: 1. ABX Air, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a certificated air carrier which owns and operates the Company's domestic express cargo service. Its wholly-owned subsidiaries are as follows: a) Wilmington Air Park, Inc., an Ohio corporation, is the owner of the Wilmington airport property (Airborne Air Park). b) Airborne FTZ, Inc., an Ohio corporation, is the holder of a foreign trade zone certificate at the Wilmington airport property and owns and manages the Company's expendable aircraft parts inventory. c) Aviation Fuel, Inc., an Ohio corporation, purchases and sells aviation and other fuels. d) Advanced Logistics Services Corp., an Ohio corporation, provides customized warehousing, inventory management and shipping services. e) Sound Suppression, Inc., an Ohio corporation with nocurrent operating activities. 2. Awawego Delivery, Inc., a New York corporation, holds trucking rights in New York and Connecticut. 3. Airborne Forwarding Corporation, a Delaware corporation doing business as Sky Courier, provides expedited courier service. 4. Airborne Freight Limited, a New Zealand corporation, provides air express and air freight services. Regulation - ----------- The Company's operations are regulated by the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT"), the FAA, and various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. The DOT, under federal transportation statutes, grants air carriers the right to engage in domestic and international air transportation. The DOT issues certificates to engage in air transportation and has the authority to modify, suspend or revoke such certificates for cause, including failure to comply with federal law or the DOT regulations. The Company believes it possesses all necessary DOT-issued certificates to conduct its operations. The FAA regulates aircraft safety and flight operations generally, including equipment, ground facilities, maintenance and communications. The FAA issues operating certificates to carriers who possess the technical competence to conduct air carrier operations. In addition, the FAA issues certificates of airworthiness to each aircraft which meets the requirements for aircraft design and maintenance. The Company believes it holds all page 9 airworthiness and other FAA certificates required for the conduct of its business, although the FAA has the power to suspend or revoke such certificates for cause, including failure to comply with federal law. The federal government generally regulates aircraft engine noise at its source. However, local airport operators may, under certain circumstances, regulate airport operations based on aircraft noise considerations. The Noise Act provides that in the case of Stage 2 aircraft restrictions, the airport operator must notify air carriers of its intention to propose rules and satisfy the requirements of federal statutes before implementation of the rules or in the case of Stage 3 aircraft, the airport operator must obtain the carriers' or the governments' approval of the rule prior to its adoption. The Company believes the operation of its aircraft either complies with or is exempt from compliance with currently applicable local airport rules. However, if more stringent aircraft operating regulations were adopted on a widespread basis, the Company might be required to expend substantial sums, make schedule changes or take other actions. The Company's aircraft currently meet all known requirements for emission levels. However, under the Clean Air Act, individual states or the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") may adopt regulations requiring the reduction in emissions for one or more localities based on the measured air quality at such localities. The EPA has proposed regulations for portions of California calling for emission reductions through restricting the use of emission producing ground service equipment or aircraft auxiliary power units. There can be no assurance, that if such regulations are adopted in the future or changes in existing laws or regulations are promulgated, such laws or rules would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. Under currently applicable federal aviation law, the Company's airline subsidiary could cease to be eligible to operate as an all-cargo carrier if more than 25% of the voting stock of the Company were owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens or the airline were not effectively controlled by U.S. citizens. Moreover, in order to hold an all-cargo air carrier certificate, the president and at least two-thirds of the directors and officers of an air carrier must be U.S. citizens. The Company has entered into a Rights Agreement designed, in part, to discourage a single foreign person from acquiring 20% or more, and foreign persons in the aggregate from acquiring 25% or more, of the Company's outstanding voting stock without the approval of the Board of Directors. To the best of the Company's knowledge, foreign stockholders do not control more than 25% of the outstanding voting stock. Two of the Company's officers are not U.S. citizens. The Company believes that its current operations are substantially in compliance with the numerous regulations to which its business is subject; however, various regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over significant aspects of the Company's business, and it is possible that new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. Financial Information Regarding International and Domestic Operations - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995 is presented in page 10 Note K (Segment Information) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the 1995 Annual Report to Shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - --------------------- The Company leases general and administrative office facilities located in Seattle, Washington. At year end the Company maintained approximately 265 domestic and 7 foreign stations, most of which are leased. The majority of the facilities are located at or near airports. The Company owns the airport at the Airborne Air Park, in Wilmington, Ohio. The airport currently consists of two runways, taxi-ways, aprons, buildings serving as aircraft and equipment maintenance facilities, a sort facility, storage facilities, a training center, and operations and administrative offices. In 1995, the Company completed a significant expansion of the airpark which included construction of a second runway, taxiways and several other facilities. The Company believes its existing facilities are adequate to meet current needs. Information regarding collateralization of certain property and lease commitments of the Company is set forth in Notes E and F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the 1995 Annual Report to Shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference.

ARTICLE 2. Delivery of the Aircraft, Title and Risk of Loss. 2.1 Time of Delivery. a. Exhibit A hereto sets forth the anticipated month for delivery of each Aircraft ("Target Month"), which represents Seller's current best estimate of the likely month such Aircraft will be available for delivery to Purchaser.

Seller shall have the right to reschedule the delivery date of each Aircraft for up to [   ] calendar days after the end of the relevant Target Month in which such delivery is scheduled hereunder. If Seller elects to reschedule the delivery date, written notice will be provided to Purchaser at the latest [   ] calendar days prior to the date set forth in the Delivery Notice. Such notice, provided by Seller to Purchaser, will include the new delivery date for such Aircraft. No rescheduling of a delivery date with respect to any Aircraft shall necessarily modify any subsequent Target Month or delivery date with respect to any other Aircraft. d. The delivery date may also be rescheduled pursuant to Excusable Delay as provided under Section 9.4 hereof. Seller shall give Purchaser notice of the rescheduled delivery date (being a date after the event of Excusable Delay has been corrected or waived). 2.2 Place of Delivery.

In the event that Purchaser fails to pay any Indemnified Tax and such Indemnified Tax is levied upon, assessed against, collected from, or otherwise imposed on the Seller, Purchaser shall immediately upon demand indemnify, protect, defend and hold the Seller harmless from and against all such Indemnified Taxes, together with any interest, penalties or other additions to such tax, and other costs (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and other professional fees) incurred by Seller in connection with such Indemnified Tax or its enforcement of this Section 2.6. Seller agrees to provide reasonable assistance and cooperation to Purchaser with respect to obtaining tax exemptions reasonably available. If a written claim is made by any tax authority against Seller with respect to any Indemnified Tax, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser. If reasonably requested by Purchaser in writing (and if requested by Seller, after Purchaser shall have delivered to Seller (i) an opinion of counsel for Purchaser reasonably satisfactory to Seller that there is a reasonable good faith basis for a contest and (ii) assurances from Purchaser in form reasonably satisfactory to Seller to indemnify Seller if the claim is adversely decided), Seller shall, at the expense of Purchaser (including, without limitation, all legal and accountants' fees and disbursements, penalties and interest), at Purchaser's direction and using counsel acceptable to Purchaser, contest in the name of Seller or, if requested by Purchaser, contest in the name of Purchaser, if permissible under applicable law (or permit Purchaser, if desired by Seller, to contest in the name of Purchaser) the validity, applicability or amount of such Indemnified Tax by (i) if permitted by applicable law without adverse consequences to Seller, resisting payment thereof, (ii) paying under protest, if protest is necessary or proper, and (iii) if payment be made, using reasonable efforts to obtain a refund thereof in appropriate administrative and judicial proceedings. If Seller shall obtain a refund of all or any part of the Indemnified Tax paid by Purchaser, Seller shall pay Purchaser the amount of such refund, plus, on an after tax basis, any interest thereon obtained by Seller from the taxing authority if fairly attributable to such Indemnified Tax. If such tax contest shall cause Seller undue hardship or burden, Seller and Purchaser shall consult in good faith concerning any tax contest to be undertaken hereunder.

Purchaser has delivered to Seller the sum of [   ] (the "First Deposit"), receipt of which is acknowledged by Seller; b. Upon execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall immediately pay to Seller the sum of [   ] (the "Second Deposit"); c. By no later than [   ], Purchaser shall pay to Seller the sum of [   ] (the "Third Deposit") (the First Deposit, Second Deposit and Third Deposit is referred to collectively as the "Final Delivery Deposit"); d. Purchaser shall pay to Seller the sum of [   ] (the "Fourth Deposits"), representing [   ] per Aircraft, which sum shall be paid as follows: [   ] shall be due upon execution of this Agreement, [   ] shall be due on or before [   ], and the balance of [   ] shall be due on or before [   ]; and e. Purchaser shall pay to Seller the sum of [   ] (the "Fifth Deposits"), representing [   ] per Aircraft, which sum shall be paid as follows: [   ] shall be due upon execution of this Agreement, and [   ] shall be due on or before the first day of the month [   ] prior to the relevant Aircraft's Target Month provided, however, that if any Deposit would otherwise be due in [   ] of any year, Purchaser shall not be required to pay such Deposit until the fifteenth (15th) day of January. Except as provided in Sections 9.5 and 9.6 below, the Deposits are non- refundable and Purchaser shall have no right to return of any Deposit after payment thereof to Seller. All interest earned on the Deposits shall be property of the Seller. Except as provided in Sections 9.5 and 9.6 below, under no circumstances shall Seller be required to refund or return any Deposit to Purchaser. 3.3 Standby Letter of Credit. As an alternative to paying the Deposits in cash as described in Sections 3.2 (b), (c), (d) or (e), Purchaser may provide, as of the dates required for the payment of the relevant Deposit, irrevocable standby letter(s) of credit (as to each, including any renewals and reissuances of any such letter of credit, a "Standby Letter of Credit"), naming Seller as beneficiary and drawable in amounts equal to such Deposit, in form substantially as set forth in Exhibit D hereto and otherwise acceptable to Seller, issued by first class financial institution(s) selected by Purchaser and acceptable to Seller. Seller agrees that first class financial institutions that at the time of issuance and throughout the term of the Standby Letter of Credit that maintain at least an "A" rating by Standard & Poor's shall be acceptable to Seller. If Purchaser intends to provide a Standby Letter of Credit, Purchaser will give Seller written notice no less than [   ] days (or shorter period in the case of Standby Letters of Credit to be delivered within [   ] days of execution of this Agreement) prior to the relevant date of Deposit, which notice shall identify the proposed financial institution and contain the proposed form of Standby Letter of Credit. In no event shall Purchaser be entitled to deliver a Standby Letter of Credit in lieu of a cash Deposit if Purchaser is then in default in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder or under the Marubeni Purchase Agreement. Each Standby Letter of Credit shall be drawable at any time after issuance, and shall have an expiry date no earlier than [   ] months after issuance provided that any Standby Letter of Credit with respect to delivery of a particular Aircraft shall not, in any event, require an expiry term in excess of [   ] days following the end of the relevant Target Month for such Aircraft, as the same may be extended for all periods of Excusable Delay with respect to the relevant Aircraft. Not later than the date that is [   ] days prior to the expiry date of each Standby Letter of Credit, Purchaser shall (a) cause such Standby Letter of Credit to be renewed and reissued in each case in the same amount and form as the Standby Letter of Credit originally issued and (b) cause such renewed and reissued Standby Letter of Credit to be delivered to Seller. Such renewed and reissued Standby Letter of Credit shall be drawable at and after the time of expiration of the Standby Letter of Credit it replaces and shall have an expiry date no earlier than the date which is [   ] months from the expiry date of the Standby Letter of Credit it replaces. In the event that any Standby Letter of Credit issuing bank becomes unacceptable to Seller, or the validity or enforceability of such Standby Letter of Credit becomes uncertain, then Purchaser shall within [   ] Business Days of demand therefor by Seller, against return by Seller of the original Standby Letter of Credit, provide to Seller a cash Deposit in the amount equal to such Standby Letter of Credit or a replacement Standby Letter of Credit of like amount which shall be in a form, and shall be issued by a financial institution, acceptable to Seller. 3.4 Payment for the Aircraft. At least [   ] Business Days prior to the relevant delivery date of each Aircraft, the parties shall establish a document escrow (the "Document Escrow") and a funds escrow (the "Funds Escrow") pursuant to a Document Escrow Letter and Funds Escrow Agreement substantially in the forms of Exhibit E and Exhibit F attached hereto.

At least [   ] Business Day prior to the applicable delivery date for such Aircraft, Purchaser and Seller, as the case may be, shall place into the Document Escrow and the Funds Escrow, the funds and documents required to be placed into escrow by them under the Funds Escrow Agreement and Documents Escrow Letter. The Funds Escrow Agent shall promptly notify Seller when all funds have been deposited into the escrow account and will disburse such funds as provided in the Funds Escrow Agreement. Seller shall credit towards the Purchase Price the Fourth and Fifth Deposits applicable to such Aircraft to the extent such Deposits are made in cash and held by Seller provided that in the case of the ninth (9th) Aircraft to be delivered hereunder, Seller shall also credit the portion of the Final Delivery Deposit to the extent such Deposits are made in cash and held by Seller towards the Purchase Price of said Aircraft. All costs and fees of the escrow agents shall be for the Purchaser's account. 3.5 Payment in U.S. Funds. All payments (including payments of the Deposits) hereunder shall be paid in United States Dollars by telegraphic transfer in immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Seller. Purchaser shall comply with all applicable monetary and exchange control regulations, and shall obtain any necessary authority from the governmental agency administering such regulations in order to enable Purchaser to make payments at the time and place in the manner and medium specified herein. Purchaser shall pay all charges and expenses including but not limited to all bank charges and assessments as well as Indemnified Taxes and fees in relation to the payment to be made hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, all payments to be made to Seller hereunder shall be made free and clear of, and without regard to, any and all Indemnified Taxes and other setoffs, counterclaims, withholdings or other deductions of any kind or nature whatsoever, unless Purchaser is required by law to make any withholding for taxes, in which case Purchaser shall (a) immediately pay to Seller such additional amount as shall be required so that Seller shall receive, on the date such payments are due, the net amount it would have received had such withholding for taxes not been required and (b) promptly pay such taxes and provide to Seller evidence of such payment. 3.6 Guaranties. All obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement shall be fully guaranteed by Airborne Freight Corporation ("Airborne") pursuant to a guaranty substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto (the "Airborne Guaranty").

Such person shall (i) suspend or discontinue its business, or (ii) make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (iii) generally not be paying its debts as such debts become due, or (iv) admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become due, or (v) file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or (vi) become insolvent (however such insolvency shall be evidenced), or (vii) file any petition or answer seeking for itself any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment of debt, liquidation or dissolution or similar relief under any present or future statute, law or regulation of any jurisdiction, or (viii) petition or apply to any tribunal for any receiver, custodian or any trustee for any substantial part of its property, or (ix) be the subject of any such proceeding filed against it which remains undismissed for a period of sixty (60) days, or (x) file any answer admitting or not contesting the material allegations of any such petition filed against it, or of any order, judgment or decree approving such petition in any such proceeding, or (xi) seek, approve, consent to, or acquiesce in any such proceeding, or in the appointment of any trustee, receiver, custodian, liquidator, or fiscal agent for it, or any substantial part of its property, or an order is entered appointing any such trustee, receiver, custodian, liquidator or fiscal agent and such order remains in effect for sixty (60) days, or (xii) take any formal action for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing or seeking the its liquidation or dissolution; b. Involuntary Bankruptcy. An order for relief is entered under the applicable bankruptcy laws or any other decree or order is entered by a court having jurisdiction in the premises and such decree or order continues undismissed and in effect for a period of sixty (60) days (i) adjudging the person bankrupt or insolvent, or (ii) approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the person under applicable bankruptcy or similar laws, or (iii) appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the person or of any substantial part of the property of any thereof, or (iv) ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the person; c.

General. Seller shall not be responsible or be liable for any damages (upon termination by Purchaser or otherwise) or deemed to be in default on account of, inability to or delays in the delivery of any Aircraft or any Aircraft Documentation or the failure of any other act to be performed by Seller hereunder due to any of the following causes: acts of God, war, warlike operations, insurrections or riots, fires, floods or explosions, earthquakes or serious accidents, epidemics or quarantine restrictions, any acts of government or governmental priorities, strikes or labor troubles causing cessation, slow-down or interruption of work, failure of or delay in transportation, or inability, after due and timely diligence, to procure materials, accessories, equipment or parts, Damage, or arising out of any other cause to the extent it is beyond Seller's reasonable control and not occasioned by Seller's fault or negligence (any such event being, an "Excusable Delay"). Without limitation, the failure of ANA to perform any of its obligations under the relevant lease between Seller and ANA or due to any other action or inaction of ANA, shall constitute an Excusable Delay. In the event of any Excusable Delays, Seller shall advise Purchaser concerning the nature and approximate extent thereof and shall thereafter from time to time advise Purchaser concerning the current status of such delays. Seller further agrees to use reasonable efforts to cause ANA to remedy such Excusable Delay, to the extent Seller may require ANA to remedy such event under the relevant lease with ANA. b. Excusable Delay - Termination. During the period of Excusable Delay which affects the delivery of an Aircraft, the time for delivery of such affected Aircraft shall be extended. In the event delivery of any Aircraft shall be delayed due to any one or more Excusable Delays for a period of more than [   ] calander days after the end of the relevant Target Month in which such delivery is otherwise required hereunder (the "Initial Period"), and if it is reasonable to believe that the relevant events of Excusable Delay will be rectified, Purchaser shall have the right, up to two times, to extend the obligations of Purchaser and Seller hereunder with respect to such Aircraft, by delivering written notice (the "Extension Notice") to Seller no later than [   ] days prior to expiration of the Initial Period or the expiration of the first Extension Period, as the case may be. The period of extension (the "Extension Periods") shall not be longer than the time reasonably calculated as necessary for the relevant event of Excusable Delay to be corrected provided that the first Extension Period shall not, in any event, exceed [   ] calendar days and the second Extension Period shall not, in any event, exceed [   ] calander days. In addition, Purchaser shall have no right to request a second Extension Period if Seller in good faith reasonably believes the matter will likely not be rectified within such second Extension Period. If the Aircraft shall not be delivered to Purchaser within the Initial Period or Extension Periods, as the case may be, then the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder with respect to that Aircraft, but not others, shall terminate and Seller shall, within [   ] days from such termination, return to Purchaser the Deposits and Standby Letters of Credit therefore received from Purchaser under Section 3.2 hereof with respect to that Aircraft (but in any event shall not return the Final Delivery Deposit, or Standby Letters of Credit applicable thereto, except if such event of Excusable Delay shall relate to the final Aircraft to be delivered hereunder). c. Excusable Delay - Damage. For purposes of this Agreement, "Damage" means: (i) material damage to the Aircraft which affects the ability of the Aircraft to satisfy the Delivery Condition of Article 4 hereof; (ii) which has not been corrected as of the date of the "C" check to be performed under Section 7.2(d) hereof; and (iii) which has been determined by ANA's insurers (or such other third party as may be acceptable to Seller, Purchaser and ANA) not to give rise to Total Loss of the Aircraft. The parties acknowledge that Damage is an event of Excusable Delay. Without limiting any other provision hereunder, Seller agrees to give prompt notice to Purchaser of any event of Damage and further agrees to use all reasonable efforts to cause ANA to repair the Aircraft in a timely and efficient manner. 9.5 Effect of Termination by Purchaser. If Purchaser shall have properly terminated this Agreement in whole pursuant to Section 9.1(a), then all remaining Deposits (except with respect to Aircraft that have been delivered prior to the date of termination) and Standby Letters of Credit shall be returned to Purchaser and Purchaser may pursue any remedies it may have under applicable law. If Purchaser shall have properly terminated this Agreement with respect to a particular Aircraft, then the relevant Deposits and relevant Standby Letters of Credit made with respect to said Aircraft (other than any of the Final Delivery Deposit and/or relevant Standby Letters of Credit with respect thereto unless said termination is with respect to the ninth (9th) Aircraft) shall be returned to Purchaser. Further, if termination with respect to an Aircraft resulted from events or actions within the reasonable control of Seller and were not excused by Excusable Delay, Purchaser may pursue any remedies it may have under applicable law with respect to said Aircraft, but Purchaser shall remain obligated to purchase and Seller shall remain obligated to sell all remaining Aircraft in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall Seller be liable to Purchaser for consequential or punitive damages, each of which is hereby expressly waived. The parties acknowledge, however, that Purchaser shall be entitled to a remedy of specific performance with respect to such matters within the reasonable control of Seller and not excused by Excusable Delay. 9.6 Effect of Termination by Seller. If Seller shall properly terminate this Agreement in whole, then Seller shall be entitled to retain as liquidated damages the amount of all Deposits paid or which should have been paid by Purchaser as of the date of termination. Without limitation, Seller shall be entitled to make immediate demand under any Standby Letter of Credit, and the financial institutions shall make payment thereunder without regard to whether there is a dispute between Seller and Purchaser concerning the propriety of demand thereunder. The parties hereby acknowledge that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to assess the damages which would be suffered by Seller as a result of termination of this Agreement, and therefore agree that in the event of any such failure or refusal by Purchaser, Seller shall be entitled to the Deposits as liquidated damages, which is not intended as a penalty but is a reasonable estimate of Seller's actual damages under those circumstances. If Seller shall have properly terminated this Agreement with respect to a particular Aircraft, Seller shall remain obligated to sell and Purchaser shall remain obligated to purchase all remaining Aircraft in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Further, unless termination with respect to a particular Aircraft shall be effected by Seller under Section 9.4(b) hereof, Seller may retain all Deposits with respect to such Aircraft (and draw under the relevant Standby Letters of Credit) as full compensation as its sole remedy for the damages caused hereunder. Purchaser waives any right to challenge Seller's right to collect liquidated damages. In the event of such challenge, however, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that such amounts constitute, among other things, a reasonable fee to Seller for committing to sell the Aircraft to Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and deferring marketing efforts for the Aircraft. 9.7 Marketing of Aircraft. If the Agreement is terminated in whole or with respect to a particular Aircraft, whether by Seller, Purchaser or both, and regardless of fault and notwithstanding any right or remedy either party may have arising therefrom, Seller shall be free of any further obligation to sell all remaining Aircraft (in the case of termination of this Agreement in whole) or such Aircraft (in the case of termination with respect to a particular Aircraft) to Purchaser hereunder. Without limitation, Purchaser shall have no further right to or interest in said Aircraft and Seller may market or otherwise dispose of said Aircraft without interference or objection by Purchaser.

Each party agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing herein shall impair the right of one party to bring any action or proceeding against another or its property in the courts of any other jurisdiction and each party irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the appropriate courts sitting in any place where property of such party is located. 10.5 Inspections. In addition to Purchaser's inspection rights under Section 7.2(d) hereof, Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to permit Purchaser, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times and at its own expense, to inspect the Aircraft and Aircraft Documentation provided that such inspections shall not interfere with ANA's usual operations. 10.6 Notices.

Primary and fully diluted earnings per share inclusive of the changes were $1.86 and $1.82, respectively. AIRBORNE FREIGHT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: Operating results for 1995 were down substantially from 1994 due to the very disappointing first half results which were below our initial expectations. Earnings in the first half of 1995 were below 1994 levels as a result of the rapid growth of lo  wer yielding deferred delivery product, a drop in the average weight per domestic shipment, and overall lower domestic yields. Second half 1995 earnings improved substantially over first half results as corrective actions designed to adjust to the new product mix and improve yields began to take effect. Net earnings available to common shareholders in 1995 decreased to $23.5 million, or $1.11 per primary share, compared to $37.9 million, or $1.81 per share in 1994. Net earnings for the second half of 1995 were $19.5 million, an increase over the second half of 1994 net earnings of $18.6 million and a substantial improvement over the $4.0 million earned in the first half of 1995.  Total revenues increased 13.6% in 1995, 14.6% in 1994, and 15.9% in 1993. Shipment volume grew to 230 million units in 1995 increasing 20.2%, compared to a 16.6% increase in 1994 and 22.9% in 1993. Domestic revenue increased 12.7% in 1995 on shipment growth of 20.3%. This compares to revenue growth of 11.8% and 17.9%, and shipment growth of 16.7% and 23.3% in 1994 and 1993, respectively. Domestic shipment growth in 1995 was impacted by a 36.4% growth rate of the Company's lower yielding deferred service product and the 11.0% growth rate of the higher yielding priority overnight service product. While the growth rate of overnight shipments was higher than the rate of growth achieved in 1994, the Company experienced a decline in the average weight per domestic shipment during the first quarter of 1995. As a result, the overall domestic revenue growth rate was considerably lower than the shipment growth rate. Domestic revenue growth during the second half of 1995 was positively impacted by the improved growth in higher yielding overnight shipments, which increased 12.8% in the last half of the year compared to only 9.1% during the first half of 1995. The Company also initiated a yield enhancement program with rate increases on specific business segments being initiated during the third and fourth quarters, with additional rate increases planned for 1996. Furthermore, after the decline in the first quarter of 1995, the average weight per shipment stabilized for the remainder of 1995, although the average for all of 1995 was lower than 1994. These factors all combined to produce a more stable domestic yield environment in the latter half of 1995 compared to the first half of the year. Although still very competitive, the domestic pricing environment during 1995 has been relatively stable. The decline in domestic revenue per shipment was 6.8% in 1995, compared to a 4.2% decline in 1994 and 4.6% in 1993. International revenue increased 18.5% in 1995 on shipment growth of 16.1% compared to revenue growth of 32.1% and 4.8% and shipment growth of 11.5% and 7.4% in 1994 and 1993, respectively. International revenue per shipment increased slightly compared to last year as a result of the overall growth in higher yielding freight shipments. However, the international revenue growth rate was lower than the previous year primarily as the result of the softness in higher yielding heavy weight shipments outbound from the Far East and from a decline in the growth rate of shipments outbound from the United States. OPERATING EXPENSES are affected by shipment volume, productivity improvements, costs incurred to increase capacity and expand service, fuel price volatility and discretionary items such as the level of marketing expenditures. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 96.9% in 1995 compared to 95.5% in 1994 and 95.2% in 1993. Measuring cost performance on a per shipment basis, total operating expenses per shipment declined substantially in 1995 to $9.43, compared to $9.83 in 1994 and $9.97 in 1993. A strong focus on cost control, productivity improvements and quality improvement programs are primarily responsible for this favorable trend. The Company achieved a 7.3% improvement in productivity in 1995, as measured by shipments handled per paid employee hour, compared to 6.0% improvement in 1994 and 12.1% in 1993. Transportation purchased increased as a percentage of revenues to 35.2% in 1995 compared to 34.0% in 1994 and 31.6% in 1993. This expense category consists primarily of commercial airline costs, contracted pick-up and delivery and trucking costs. The increase in 1995 is primarily due to additional contracted pick-up and delivery costs to accommodate volume growth and to additional commercial airline costs for lift purchased directly from other carriers, resulting from the growth in international freight shipments discussed above. Station and ground expense as a percentage of revenues was 31.0% in 1995 compared to 30.2% in 1994 and 30.6% in 1993. Productivity gains in pick-up and delivery, customer service and hub operations have been instrumental in partially offsetting the effect of increased costs incurred to accommodate the growth in shipments and expand service while maintaining service integrity. Shipment volume handled through ten regional sort facilities, which approximated 25.4% and 22.8% of total domestic shipment weight handled in December 1995 and 1994, respectively, resulted in incrementally lower transportation and handling costs. Flight operations and maintenance expense as a percentage of revenues was 14.6% in 1995 compared to 14.2% in 1994 and 14.1% in 1993. The average aviation fuel price in 1995 was $0.60 per gallon, which was also the average price per gallon in 1994, and was approximately $0.05 per gallon lower than 1993. The average price above excludes the effect of a 4.3 cent per gallon excise tax on jet fuel that became effective October 1, 1995. This tax added approximately $1.7 million of additional cost to fourth quarter 1995 operating costs. 1996 aviation fuel costs will be negatively impacted by this excise tax as well. Aviation fuel consumption increased 14.9% to 142.2 million gallons in 1995. The increase in fuel consumption is a result of additional Company operated aircraft placed in service during the past year to accommodate the growth in business. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased to 7.0% in 1995 compared to 7.4% in 1994 and 8.1% in 1993. Sales and marketing was 2.7% of revenues in 1995 compared to 2.7% in 1994 and 2.9% in 1993. Productivity gains and controls on discretionary spending in these two expense categories have been instrumental in offsetting the effect of increased costs incurred to accommodate shipment growth and expand service as well as inflationary cost increases. General and administrative expense includes profit sharing expense of $3.0 million in 1995, compared to $4.8 million in 1994 and $5.7 million in 1993. Depreciation and amortization expense declined as a percentage of revenues to 6.4% in 1995 compared to 7.0% in 1994 and 7.8% in 1993. The total dollar amount of depreciation and amortization has continued to increase over the last three years as a result of capital expenditures incurred primarily to expand the airline operations. INTEREST EXPENSE increased in 1995 compared to 1994 as the result of a higher level of average outstanding borrowings and higher average interest rates. Interest capitalized in 1995 of $3.7 million, was primarily related to the acquisition and modification of aircraft and the airport expansion, and was approximately $1.6 million higher than the amount capitalized in 1994 and 1993. INCOME TAXES for 1995 resulted in an effective tax rate of 39.9% compared to 39.6% in 1994 and 40.2% in 1993. The Company anticipates that the effective tax rate for 1996 will be comparable to 1995. As the Company stated at the end of 1994, it is apparent that the domestic market for priority overnight service is maturing, and looking ahead, this segment of the business is likely to continue to grow at a slower rate than the deferred delivery service. The Company experienced this to be the case in 1995 and believes this is a trend that will continue to impact the entire industry for the foreseeable future. As was the case last year, the challenge going forward will be to continue to adjust the Company's operations to respond to this changing mix of business, lowering the cost per shipment to improve margins. Further, the strength of the U.S. and global economies will have a major impact on the results of operations in 1996 and beyond. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued certain Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) in 1995 which the Company will be required to adopt in 1996. SFAS No. 121 specifies that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment and potentially written down, when the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. SFAS No. 123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock option plans, but allows companies to continue to use the intrinsic value method. As permitted by the new standard, the Company has elected to not adopt the fair value method to measure compensation cost associated with employee stock options. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide further details regarding these two new standards. FINANCIAL CONDITION: CAPITAL EXPENDITURES and financing associated with those expenditures have been the primary factors affecting the financial condition of the Company over the last three years. Total capital expenditures net of dispositions were $214 million in 1995 compared to $168 million in 1994 and $139 million in 1993. A significant portion of these expenditures has been related to the acquisition and modification of aircraft and related flight equipment. The Company acquired 5 DC-8 and 2 DC-9 aircraft in 1995 and a total of 8 aircraft were placed into service during the year. At the end of 1995 the Company had 105 aircraft in service, consisting of 33 DC-8's, 61 DC-9's and 11 YS-11's. In addition, there were 3 aircraft in modification status and 1 aircraft that had not been modified. Other capital expenditures in 1995 included vehicles for expansion and replacement, facilities and package handling equipment related to servicing the increased shipment volume, leasehold improvements for new or expanded facilities and for computer equipment. Also, the second runway at the Company's airport facility was completed in late 1995. Capital expenditures will continue to be a significant factor affecting financial condition in 1996. The Company anticipates 1996 capital expenditures of approximately $225 million. A significant portion of the 1996 capital investment is for the acquisition of 7 additional aircraft, the modification of aircraft to be placed in service, the retrofitting of aircraft with Stage III hush kits, and the continued expansion of the central sort facilities. A total of 8 aircraft are expected to be placed in service in 1996. In late 1995, the Company announced a new aircraft program relative to a commitment to purchase 12 used Boeing 767-200's between the years 1997 and 2000. The Company also intends to pursue the acquisition of 10 to 15 additional used 767-200 aircraft in the years 2000 to 2004. These proposed acquisitions are not expected to significantly increase capital spending. Instead, this newer generation aircraft should increase operating efficiency while keeping capital requirements relatively unchanged. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES: Liquidity for financing capital expenditures in 1995 came from two principal sources - internally generated cash provided from operations and a major financing transaction. Internally generated cash provided from operations approximated $170 million in 1995 compared to $183 million in 1994 and $174 million in 1993. In addition, any need for liquidity during the year was provided by the revolving bank credit agreement. The revolving bank credit agreement has traditionally been used as a major source of liquidity for periods of time between other financing transactions that provide liquidity. The Company amended its revolving bank credit agreement effective March 31, 1995 increasing the total commitment from $240 million to $250 million. Commitments are subject to a maximum level of Company indebtedness permitted by certain convenants in the agreement and other loan agreements. The amended agreement is effective through May 31, 1998, with the option to extend to May 31, 2000. The Company also has available $65 million under uncommitted money market lines of credit with several banks, used in conjunction with the revolving credit agreement to facilitate settlement and accommodate short-term borrowing fluctuations. At December 31, 1995, a total of $143.3 million was owing under the revolving bank credit and money market agreements. In September 1995, the Company issued $100 million of 7.35% notes due September 15, 2005. The net proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down the Company's bank lines of credit, and replaced floating rate debt with a fixed rate. In August 1995, the Company's long term senior debt classification was downgraded by Standard & Poor's from "BBB+" to "BBB", citing the pressure on domestic yields as the primary factor. Moody's rating of "Baa3" remained unchanged. The Company's ratio of senior long-term debt to total capitalization was 39.3% and the ratio of total long-term debt to total capitalization was 51.7% at December 31, 1995, compared to 34.0% and 48.5%, respectively, at December 31, 1994. Anticipated cash flow from 1996 operations should provide the majority of the liquidity for projected 1996 capital expenditures. These debt to capitalization ratios are not expected to change significantly during 1996 from the 1995 year end level. In management's opinion, the available capacity under the bank credit agreements coupled with anticipated internally generated cash flow from 1996 operations should provide adequate flexibility for financing future growth. INFLATION: The rate of inflation has been relatively constant over the past several years, and so has the impact of inflation on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The effects of inflation have been considered in management's discussion where considered pertinent. See notes to consolidated financial statements. See notes to consolidated financial statements.

AIRBORNE FREIGHT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Three Years Ended December 31, 1995 NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES: NATURE OF OPERATIONS The Company's revenues are derived from domestic and international transportation of shipments. The Company provides door-to-door express delivery of small packages and documents throughout the United States and to most foreign countries. The Company also acts as an international and domestic freight forwarder for shipments of any size. Most domestic shipments are transported on the Company's own airline and a fleet of ground transportation vehicles through its Company-owned airport and central sorting facilities, or one of ten regional hubs. International shipments are transported utilizing a combination of the Company's domestic network, commercial airline lift capacity, and through a network of offshore Company offices and independent agents. The Company is subject to certain business risks which could affect future operations and financial performance. These risks include weather and natural disaster related disruptions, collective bargaining labor disputes, fuel price volatility, regulatory compliance concerning the operation or maintenance of aircraft, and aggressive competitor pricing. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately 8,800 employees (45% of total employees), including approximately 660 pilots, employed under collective bargaining agreements with various locals of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Warehousemen. The pilots are covered by an agreement which became amendable on July 31, 1995. Most labor agreements covering the Company's ground personnel will expire in 1998. The Company has not experienced any significant disruptions from labor disputes in the past. The Company believes the contract with the pilots will be amended without experiencing any work disruptions. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly own subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the financial statements. The Company has used estimates in determining certain provisions and reserves including those for engine overhaul costs, useful lives for fixed assets, insurance claims, uncollectible trade accounts receivable, and tax liabilities. CASH The Company has a cash management system under which a cash overdraft exists for uncleared checks in the Company's primary disbursement accounts. The cash amount in the accompanying financial statements represents balances in other accounts prior to being transferred to the primary disbursement accounts. Uncleared checks of $39,971,000 and $36,085,000 are included in accounts payable at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. SPARE PARTS AND FUEL INVENTORY Spare parts are stated at average cost and fuel inventory is stated at cost on first-in, first-out basis. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment, including rotable aircraft parts, are stated at cost. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss reflected in earnings from operations. Flight equipment carries residual values ranging from 10% to 15% of asset cost. All other property and equipment have no assigned residual values. Major engine overhauls for DC-9 aircraft are accrued in advance of the next scheduled overhaul based upon engine usage and estimates of overhaul costs. Provision for engine overhauls is included in depreciation and amortization expense. Major engine overhauls as well as ordinary engine maintenance and repairs for DC-8 aircraft are performed by a third-party service provider under a contract expiring in 2004. Service costs under the contract are based upon an hourly rate for engine usage and are charged to expense in the period utilization occurs. Major engine overhauls for YS- 11 aircraft and expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long- Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of", which will be effective for fiscal 1996. SFAS No. 121 requires that the carrying values of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment, and potentially written down, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. CAPITALIZED INTEREST Interest incurred during the construction period of certain facilities and on aircraft purchase and modification costs are capitalized as an additional cost of the asset until the date the asset is placed in service. Capitalized interest was $3,741,000, $2,127,000, and $2,094,000 for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. INCOME TAXES The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the timing of reporting certain revenues and expenses for financial versus tax purposes. Deferred taxes are measured using provisions of currently enacted tax laws. Tax credits are accounted for as a reduction of income taxes in the year in which the credit originates. EARNINGS PER SHARE Primary earnings per common share are based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus dilutive common equivalent shares applicable to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options. The weighted average number of shares outstanding were 21,204,000, 21,001,000, and 19,596,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Fully diluted earnings per share includes the potential dilution for stock options and, when material, conversion of the 6.9% redeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock and conversion of the 6.75% convertible subordinated debentures. Net earnings are adjusted for the assumed elimination of preferred stock dividends and interest expense, net of income tax, on the debentures, as applicable. REVENUE RECOGNITION Domestic revenues and most domestic operating expenses are recognized when shipments are picked up from the customer. International revenues and direct air carrier expenses are recognized in the period when shipments are tendered to a carrier for transport to a foreign destination. Domestic and international delivery costs are recognized in the period incurred. The net revenue resulting from existing recognition policies does not materially differ from that which would be recognized on a delivery date basis. FAIR VALUE INFORMATION Discussion regarding the fair value of the above financial instruments are disclosed in the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements. Carrying amounts for cash, trade accounts receivable, and current liabilities approximate fair value. ACCOUNTING CHANGES The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" and SFAS No. 106 "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" effective January 1, 1993. SFAS No. 109 required the change from the deferral method of accounting for income taxes to the asset and liability method which recognizes taxes at currently enacted rates. The result of this change, recorded cumulatively, was an increase to 1993 net earnings of $5,506,000 or $.28 per primary common share. The provisions of SFAS No. 106 require expected postretirement health care benefit costs be accrued over the applicable employee service period instead of as claims are incurred. The effect of immediate recognition of the postretirement transition obligation of $2,543,000 was a decrease in 1993's net earnings of $1,678,000 or $.08 per primary share, net of a deferred tax benefit of $865,000. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the classification used in 1995. NOTE B - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:  (614,120) ---------- --------- $ 842,703 $ 766,346 ========== ========= NOTE C - ACCRUED EXPENSES:  NOTE D - INCOME TAXES: NOTE E - LONG-TERM AND SUBORDINATED DEBT: The Company has a revolving bank credit agreement providing for a total commitment of $250,000,000. Interest rates for borrowings are generally determined by maturities selected and prevailing market conditions. The revolving credit agreement is for an initial period expiring May 31, 1998, with options to extend the maturity to May 31, 2000. The Company was in compliance with covenants of the current and previous revolving credit agreements during 1995, 1994 and 1993, including net worth restrictions which limit the payment of dividends ($103,809,000 of retained earnings was not restricted at December 31, 1995). The Company has available $65,000,000 of financing under uncommitted money market lines of credit with several banks. These facilities bear interest at rates that vary with the banks' cost of funds and are typically less than the prevailing bank prime rate. These credit lines are used in conjunction with the revolving credit agreement to facilitate settlement and accommodate short-term borrowing fluctuations. The Company has classified the borrowings outstanding under the money market lines of credit as long-term. These amounts will be refinanced under the revolving credit agreement. The Company's tax-exempt airport facilities refunding bonds carry no sinking fund requirements and bear interest at weekly adjustable rates. The average interest rate on these borrowings was 3.9% during 1995. Payment of principal and interest is secured by an irrevocable bank letter of credit that is collateralized by a mortgage on certain airport properties which have a net carrying value of $35,079,000 at December 31, 1995. The Company's 6.75% convertible subordinated debentures require no sinking fund payments prior to maturity. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of the Company at a redemption price of 104.2% declining ratably on an annual basis each August to par at maturity. The debentures are convertible into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $35.50 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. The Company has reserved 3,239,437 shares of common stock for such conversion. The scheduled annual principal payments on long-term and subordinated debt for the next five years, assuming no extension of the revolving credit notes, is $5,790,000, $351,000, $143,678,000, $408,000, and $439,000 for 1996 through 2000, respectively. The fair value information shown in Note A reflects values for the Company's senior notes and convertible subordinated debentures based on quoted market prices for the same issues. The carrying value of the Company's remaining long-term financial debt instruments approximate fair value primarily because of the repricing frequency of the instruments. NOTE F - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: OPERATING LEASES The Company is obligated under various long-term operating lease agreements for certain equipment and for a substantial portion of its facilities. These leases expire at various dates through 2013. Rental expense for 1995, 1994, and 1993 was $97,461,000, $89,975,000, and $81,138,000, respectively. COMMITMENTS Under various agreements, the Company is committed to purchase 25 aircraft consisting of 2 McDonnell Douglas DC-8, 11 DC-9, and 12 Boeing 767 aircraft to be acquired at various dates through 2000. The Company also has commitments to purchase 31 Stage III hush kits for its DC-8 and DC-9 aircraft at various dates through 1998. At December 31, 1995, deposits of $6,550,000 had been made toward these purchases. Additional deposits and payments for these acquisitions will approximate $44,959,000, $80,795,000, $84,000,000, $76,100,000, and $34,800,000 for 1996 through 2000, respectively. The Company has entered into contracts with financial institutions to limit its exposure to volatility in jet fuel prices. Under terms of the contracts, the Company either makes or receives payments if the market price of heating oil, as determined by an index of the monthly NYMEX Heating Oil futures contracts, exceeds or is lower than certain prices agreed to between the Company and the financial institutions. Settlements, if any, would be recorded as either an increase or decrease to fuel expense. The Company believes this index provides the best correlation to its jet fuel transactions. The contracts extend through December 1996, and represent an annual notional sum of 76 million gallons which represents approximately 50% of the Company's prospective average annual consumption of jet fuel. The Company had neither received nor made payments related to these contracts during 1995. Based on current market prices, the fair value of these contracts at December 31, 1995, was approximately $488,000. CONTINGENCIES In the normal course of business, the Company has various legal claims and other contingent matters outstanding. Management believes that any ultimate liability arising from these actions would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 1995. NOTE G - POSTRETIREMENT PLANS: PENSIONS The Company has trusteed retirement plans for all employees not covered by multi-employer plans to which the Company contributes under terms of various collective bargaining agreements. The Company retirement plans consist of defined contribution profit sharing and capital accumulation plans and defined benefit minimum monthly retirement income plans. The capital accumulation plans are funded by both voluntary employee salary deferrals of up to 16% of annual compensation and by employer matching contributions of 35% of employee salary deferrals up to 6% of annual compensation. The Company matching contribution expense was $3,823,000, $3,635,000, and $2,926,000 for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. Contributions to the profit sharing plans are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. However, a basic formula has been followed for contributions of 7% of earnings before taxes up to a specific profit level plus 14% of earnings in excess of that level. The Company's profit sharing expense was $2,984,000, $4,838,000, and $5,672,000 for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. The profit sharing plans hold 449,161 shares of the Company's common stock at December 31, 1995, representing 2.1% of outstanding shares. The profit sharing plans are expected to be a primary retirement benefit. The minimum monthly retirement income plans guarantee a minimum level of monthly pension income for those not accruing sufficient balances in the profit sharing plans. The Company's funding of the plans is equal to the amounts required by ERISA. The Company also has a non-qualified, unfunded supplemental retirement plan for certain key executives which provides defined retirement benefits that supplement those provided by the Company's other retirement plans. Pension expense for this plan was $1,405,000, $1,042,000, and $550,000, in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. The plan's projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and accrued pension liability was $4,962,000, $1,832,000 and $3,609,000 at December 31, 1995 and $2,373,000, $367,000 and $2,212,000 at December 31, 1994. The Company additionally contributes to several multi-employer defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees under collective bargaining agreements. Total expense of these plans was $24,278,000, $19,056,000, and $16,676,000 for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. HEALTH CARE BENEFITS The Company provides postretirement health care benefits for employees and qualifying dependents who have met certain eligibility requirements and who are not covered by other plans to which the Company contributes, such as collectively bargained plans. The Company's plan is currently unfunded. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $5,329,900 and $3,919,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, of which $4,648,000 and $4,057,000 has been accrued in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Postretirement benefit expense was $861,000, $865,000, and $649,000 for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring benefit costs was 10% for 1995, decreasing each successive year to a 6% annual growth rate in 1999, and thereafter. A one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would not have a material effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or cost as of or for the year ended December 31, 1995. The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7% and 8% at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Company also contributes to multi-employer defined benefit welfare plans covering substantially all employees under collective bargaining agreements. Portions of the these contributions, which cannot be disaggregated, relate to postretirement benefits for plan participants. Total expense of these plans was $28,968,000, $22,955,000, and $19,741,000 for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. NOTE H - PREFERRED STOCK: The Company has outstanding 78,950 shares of 6.9% redeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock, at par value of $50 per share at December 31, 1995. The shares are convertible into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $23.393 per share, subject to certain antidilutive provisions. The Company has reserved 168,747 shares of common stock for such conversion. Shares which are not converted to common stock may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price of 102.76% and declining ratably on an annual basis to par on December 1999. The holders have the option of requiring the Company to redeem, at par value, 6,000 shares annually and 54,000 shares cumulatively through December 2004. In December 2004, the Company is required to redeem all outstanding shares at par value plus accrued dividends. In January 1995, the holders exercised the right to convert 21,050 preferred shares with a par value of $1,052,500, into the Company's common stock. The transaction resulted in the issuance of 44,992 common shares. The nonvoting preferred shares are senior to common shares both as to accumulated dividends and liquidation preferences. Dividends are payable quarterly. The fair value information shown in Note A was computed assuming the stock was converted, at the option of the holder, to the Company's common shares utilizing the December 31, 1995 and 1994 closing market prices of the Company's common stock of $26.63 and $20.50 per share. NOTE I - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY: NOTE J - STOCK OPTIONS: Under shareholder approved option plans, officers, directors and key employees may be granted options to purchase the Company's common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. Options granted become exercisable over a period of six months to three years following the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. A summary of the Company's stock option plans is as follows: The Financial Accounting Standard Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" in 1995. SFAS No. 123 is required to be implemented during fiscal 1996. SFAS No. 123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock option plans, but also allows companies to continue to use the intrinsic value based method as prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees". The Company has elected not to adopt the fair value method provisions and will continue to measure compensation cost in accordance with APB No. 25. NOTE K - SEGMENT INFORMATION: Substantially all of the Company's revenues are derived from domestic and international transportation and/or forwarding of air freight and express shipments. Domestic is defined as any shipment with an origin and destination within the U.S., Puerto Rico or Canada. A substantial portion of international revenue originates in the U.S. ($279,164,000 in 1995, $234,607,000 in 1994, and $181,491,000 in 1993). The determination of operating income of domestic and international operations requires that certain costs incurred in the U.S. be allocated to international operations. The Company changed its cost allocation method in 1995 and accordingly, earnings from operations for 1994 and 1993 differ from amounts previously reported. NOTE L - SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATION: In connection with the 1995 issuance of $100,000,000 of Senior Notes due September, 2005 (Notes) certain of the Company's subsidiaries (collectively, "Guarantors") have fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, the Company's obligations to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes. The Guarantors are ABX Air, Inc. (ABX) and Airborne Forwarding Corporation (AFC), which are wholly-owned by the Company, and Airborne FTZ, Inc. (FTZ) and Wilmington Air Park, Inc. (WAP), which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of ABX. Non-guarantor subsidiaries' assets, liabilities, revenues and net earnings are inconsequential both individually and on a combined basis in comparison to the Company's consolidated financial statement totals. Management does not consider disclosure of separate subsidiary financial statements for each Guarantor to be material. Summarized financial information of the Guarantors on a combined basis is as follows (in thousands): ABX is a certificated air carrier which owns and operates the domestic express cargo services for which the Company is the sole customer. ABX also offers air charter services on a limited basis to third-party customers. FTZ owns certain aircraft parts inventory which it sells primarily to ABX, with limited sales to third-party customers. FTZ is also the holder of a foreign trade zone certificate at Wilmington airport property. WAP is the owner of the Wilmington airport property which includes the Company's main sort facility, aircraft maintenance facilities, runways and related airport facilities and airline administrative and training facilities. ABX is the only occupant and customer of WAP. AFC, d.b.a. Sky Courier, provides expedited courier services and regional logistics warehousing primarily to third-party customers. Investment balances and revenues between Guarantors have been eliminated for purposes of presenting the above summarized financial information. Intercompany revenues and net earnings recorded by ABX, FTZ, and WAP are controlled by the Company and are based on various discretionary factors. Intercompany payable amounts represent net amounts due the Company by its Guarantors. The Company provides the Guarantors with a majority of the cash necessary to fund operating and capital expenditure requirements. Federal income taxes allocated to the Guarantors have been computed assuming the subsidiaries filed a separate return. NOTE M - QUARTERLY RESULTS (Unaudited): INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT Board of Directors Airborne Freight Corporation Seattle, Washington We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Airborne Freight Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of net earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
