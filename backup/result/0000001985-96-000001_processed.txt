BUSINESS (a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS ACCEL International Corporation ("ACCEL") is an insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware in June 1978 as the successor to an Ohio corporation, formerly Acceleration Corporation, organized in 1969. Unless the context requires otherwise, the "Company" includes ACCEL and its subsidiaries. The Company has been engaged in the sale and underwriting of credit life and credit accident and health insurance, extended service contracts, vendor's single interest and other specialty casualty products. The credit insurance and extended service contract products continue to be offered to consumers, principally through automobile dealers, financial institutions and other business entities. From 1986 through 1991, the Company offered a realtors' errors and omissions insurance product that was sold through an unaffiliated marketing organization which provided various products and services to realtor member entities; that product has been in run-off since 1991. The vendor's single interest product was marketed by a managing general agent ("MGA") and was discontinued in mid 1994. In 1990, the Company began offering farmowners' multi-peril and ancillary inland marine coverages through a network of selected agents. These coverages were discontinued in early 1995. See NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS for further information. (b) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS Through 1995 the Company operated predominately in two industry segments: life and health and property and casualty insurance. See "Note J" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS GENERAL The Company's life and health insurance segment primarily consists of individual and group credit life and group credit accident and health insurance, which is sold through automobile dealers and financial institutions. The Company's property and casualty segment consists of extended service contracts, sold primarily through automobile dealers, the discontinued farmowners' multi-peril and ancillary inland marine coverages ("farmowners'"), which were marketed through independent agents. In 1996 the Company began working with agents which control books of business ("program business") that market long haul trucking, commercial buses and package policies for auto dealers. Credit insurance and extended service contracts, which represent a significant portion of the Company's business, are affected by automobile sales. These premiums accounted for approximately 90% of the Company's gross premiums written in 1995. The Company's principal subsidiary engaged in the life and health insurance business is Acceleration Life Insurance Company ("ALIC"), which holds licenses to do business in 40 states and the District of Columbia. Credit life and credit accident and health insurance are the primary insurance products written by ALIC. The Company's property and casualty business is conducted through Acceleration National Insurance Company ("ANIC"). ANIC holds licenses to do business in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Acceleration National Service Corporation ("ANSC") administers the Company's extended service contracts. The majority of the Company's direct premium revenue in 1995 was derived from sales in Ohio (47%), Virginia (13%), Michigan (7%), Indiana (7%) and North Carolina (5%). As of March, 1996, ALIC and ANIC are no longer licensed to write business in Michigan, and accordingly have discontinued their writings in said state. CREDIT INSURANCE The Company sells credit insurance primarily in connection with consumer credit transactions, of which the most significant to the Company are automobile purchases. Credit life insurance provides funds, in the event of the insured's death, for payment of a specified loan or loans which are obligations of the insured. Similarly, credit accident and health insurance provides for payments on such loans during the term of the insured's disability. In most cases, the entire premium is paid at the time the insurance is issued and such insurance is designed to cover the risk of loss for the scheduled term of the indebtedness. Most credit insurance is written on a decreasing term basis. The policy benefit is initially the amount of the unpaid indebtedness and decreases in amounts corresponding to the repayment schedule. The primary beneficiary under credit insurance is the lender. Substantially all of the Company's credit insurance is group insurance. Group credit insurance policies are issued to master policyholders (typically automobile dealers or financial institutions). The master policy of insurance authorizes the master policyholder to issue certificates representing insurance sold to its customers. Premiums collected from customers are remitted to the Company net of commissions. The Company uses good health statements as part of its underwriting measures, which inquire about the proposed insured's health at the time the insurance is to be issued. Although medical examinations are not required, the good health statement is intended to reduce the acceptance of certain risks. The Company also uses additional health related questions on its applications related to specific medical conditions. Because such conditions, if experienced within the twelve months prior to the loan date, could be expected to result in claims during the term of the loan, the applications are denied. In addition to other sales and marketing services, the Company conducts related training programs for finance and insurance managers, master policyholders and their salespeople, independent agents and sales representatives employed by the Company. The Company reinsures substantial percentages of its credit accident and health premiums on a written basis. This reinsurance provides statutory surplus relief, thereby increasing the Company's capacity to write credit insurance. An effect of this reinsurance is, however, to reduce the profit that the Company might otherwise realize on its credit insurance business. The applicable agreement contains an experience adjustment computation which results in the ultimate cost of this reinsurance being a stated percentage related to the business ceded. Under such arrangements, a security fund is usually maintained by the Company approximating the amount of ceded unearned premiums less commissions retained, plus ceded insurance claims. The Company has also entered into agreements to cede credit life and credit accident and health insurance to reinsurance companies owned by certain automobile dealers, financial institutions or agents. Under these arrangements said entities and persons participate in the profits or losses of the insurance sold through them, and the Company retains nominal percentages of the related risk. These agreements generally provide that the Company receive a ceding fee and be reimbursed for commissions and claims. Approximately 76%, 73% and 44% of the Company's gross premiums written during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, were derived from its credit insurance business. The credit insurance business decreased 3.6% in 1995 compared to 1994, increased 4% in 1994 compared to 1993, and increased 22% in 1993 compared to 1992. Automobile purchases continue to be the most significant consumer credit transaction for which credit insurance is sold by the Company. Automobile purchases have been and will continue to be affected, directly and indirectly, by auto prices, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions. The primary states in which the Company's credit insurance is sold are Ohio, Virginia, Indiana and West Virginia. The Company markets its credit insurance through both independent agents and its own direct sales representatives. A significant portion of the Company's gross credit insurance premiums were attributable to the Company's independent agents. In 1987 the Company entered into a joint marketing arrangement with Consumers Financial Corporation ("CFC") and transferred all of its Pennsylvania credit insurance accounts to CFC's subsidiary, Consumers Life Insurance Company. This business had previously been marketed by the Company's employees. The joint venture also provides for the marketing of automobile extended service contracts in Pennsylvania. The Company and CFC have combined their capabilities for marketing these products to automobile dealer accounts which both parties have serviced in the past and efforts continue to sign-up additional accounts. NEW PROPERTY AND CASUALTY PRODUCTS The Company has recently commenced new marketing initiatives in the Property and Casualty markets which have resulted in new business being written in the first quarter of 1996. These marketing efforts are directed toward agents who control books of program business. The lines include long haul trucking, commercial buses and package policies for auto dealers. The Company has employed individuals with extensive experience in these lines of business. In addition, two senior executives have considerable experience with these lines and with the producing agents. The Company anticipates a positive contribution from this business in 1996. EXTENDED SERVICE CONTRACTS Extended service contracts are sold under the name "Co$tGuard" and cover the cost of labor and certain parts for the repair of automobiles, motorcycles and watercraft. The Company's product covers towing, rental car reimbursement and other benefits during the entire contract term and enables a purchaser to obtain from the selling dealer a service contract covering the cost (in excess of a deductible amount where applicable) of repairs to covered parts subsequent to the expiration of the applicable manufacturer's warranty and the cost of other services. Extended service contracts are primarily marketed through the same group of automobile dealers who market the Company's credit insurance. The extended service contract program is marketed on a net cost basis to the automobile dealer who is free to establish the retail price for the contract. The net cost paid by the dealer includes the premiums for a contractual liability policy provided the dealer by ANIC, and administrative and marketing fees. In 1995, this program accounted for approximately 97% of ANIC's net retained premiums written. In 1992 the Company began to reinsure a limited number of its extended service contracts to reinsurance companies owned by automobile dealers. The Company expects reinsurance to become a major marketing factor in the future. REALTORS' ERRORS AND OMISSIONS INSURANCE Since mid-1986 ANIC provided errors and omissions insurance to members of a realtors' association in connection with their activities principally in noncommercial real estate transactions. ANIC reinsured the risk to an unaffiliated reinsurance company. An independent insurance broker was acting as broker/agent for ANIC in connection with the issuance, administration and policy services for this business. ANIC retained 25% of the premiums written for its participation in this program. On October 29, 1990, ANIC gave notice of termination to the broker/agent through which the realtors' errors and omissions ("E&O") coverage was marketed. The termination of this arrangement became effective January 31, 1991. In addition, the Company commuted the reinsurance agreement for this program. See "Note F" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. After termination, ANIC assumed responsibility for handling and processing all claims related to this business and discovered certain matters which resulted in litigation being commenced against the marketing organization and broker. See "Certain Events" under MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OTHER INSURANCE PRODUCTS In early 1990, the Company introduced its farmowners' multi-peril and ancillary inland marine coverage products. Premiums written for these products were $97,000, $8,460,000 and $11,882,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The Company elected to discontinue offering these lines and entered into an agreement whereby the Company ceded 100% of the in-force business at December 31, 1994. Accordingly, any new business written after January 1, 1995 was reinsured with an unaffiliated carrier. As of June 30, 1995, the Company ceased writing this business. INVESTMENT IN RANDJILL GROUP LTD. ("RGL") AND GALAXY INSURANCE COMPANY ("GALAXY") In 1986 the Company acquired a 20% interest in RGL, a company related through common ownership by a shareholder and director of the Company, and in 1991 acquired the remaining 80% interest. The total amount invested in RGL was approximately $10.3 million. Due to significant losses incurred, and the insolvency of RGL's operating subsidiary, Galaxy, a New York domiciled property and casualty insurance company, the Company wrote off its investment in RGL during the second quarter of 1994. For further information regarding RGL see "Note K" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 1995, the Company employed 78 full-time equivalent employees compared to 98 at December 31, 1994. REINSURANCE WITH UNAFFILIATED INSURANCE COMPANIES Reinsurance enables insurance companies to provide greater diversification of risks and at the same time minimize risk exposure. The reinsurer reimburses the Company for any claims on the reinsured portion of the risk. Although reinsurance does not discharge the Company from primary liability to the insured for the full amount of the insurance coverage, the industry and regulatory practice is to exclude the reinsured portion of the risk from the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has an arrangement in place which covers a substantial portion of its credit insurance business with an unaffiliated insurance company. The effect of this agreement is that the Company ultimately retains a substantial part of the insurance risk, the underwriting income or loss and the investment income on net funds, all of which are retained by the Company, with the reinsurers receiving a stated percentage of the ceded business. See "Note F" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 1993, the Company entered into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurers related to its discontinued health products. The effect of such reinsurance arrangements was to transfer 100% of the related risk to the reinsurers. Premiums ceded associated with these agreements and included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations amounted to $633,000, $980,000 and $4,588,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. REINSURANCE WITH PRODUCER-OWNED REINSURANCE COMPANIES Certain automobile dealers, financial institutions and insurance agencies, which generate credit insurance premiums and are master policyholders of the Company, have formed Producer-owned Reinsurance Companies owned either wholly or in part, directly or indirectly, by such master policyholders to reinsure credit life and disability business generated by them. These arrangements are structured to provide Producer-owned Reinsurance Companies with underwriting income and a portion of investment income on the premiums ceded in connection with such reinsurance. In these transactions the Company's revenue is limited to a ceding fee and a portion of the investment income. As of December 31, 1995, $10,813,000 of credit life and disability unearned premium reserves were ceded by the Company to Producer-owned Reinsurance Companies. However, most Producer-owned Reinsurance Companies are required to deposit cash and marketable securities in a custodial account with an independent financial institution. The minimum balance in each account is generally required to be equal to the policy and claim reserves ceded to the Producer-owned Reinsurance Companies. In the event a Producer-owned Reinsurance Company fails to fulfill its obligation, the Company may withdraw funds from the Producer-owned Reinsurance Company's account as reimbursement for premium refunds and claim disbursements. On all insurance written by the Company and reinsured with Producer-owned Reinsurance Companies, the Company remains liable in the event of the insolvency of the reinsurers. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had ceded approximately $281,195,000 of credit life insurance in-force to Producer-owned Reinsurance Companies. See "Note F" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. COMPETITION The Company's business is extremely competitive as to both price and service. In the credit insurance business the Company's competitors include other insurance companies, many of which are larger than the Company and have greater resources. A significant competitive factor is the commission which may be paid to licensed agents affiliated with master policyholders. The Company, however, continues to compete by offering what it believes to be realistic commissions and providing a high level of service including training, consulting and related services to its master policyholders. In the property and casualty segment, the Company competes with much larger and established national and regional insurance companies and with automobile manufacturers which provide service contracts to their dealers. The automobile manufacturers have significantly greater resources than the Company and have relationships with automobile dealers which extend beyond providing service contracts. The principal competitive factors include price, profit potential, type and quality of the products offered and the quality of service. Many of the same master policyholders which sell the Company's credit insurance also market its extended service contracts, and the termination of the relationship in one segment could affect the Company's relationship in the other segment. REGULATION The Company is subject to regulation in the states in which it does business. The extent of such regulation varies from state to state; but in general, all states have statutory restrictions and a supervisory agency which has broad discretionary administrative powers. Such regulation is designed primarily to protect policyholders and relates to the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms, the methods of computing reserves, the form and content of financial reports and the type and concentration of permitted investments. Ohio and other jurisdictions in which the Company does business have enacted legislation providing for specific regulation of the relationship between licensed insurers and affiliated members of a holding company group. Such legislation generally (1) establishes requirements and procedures relative to the approval or disapproval of mergers and other acquisitions of control, (2) prescribes the filing of registration statements by insurers which are members of the holding company group, (3) subjects the holding company to reporting requirements, (4) establishes standards for transactions between insurers and their holding companies and between members of a holding company group and (5) controls the payment of extraordinary dividends. The dividends which the Company may receive from both its life and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements as to minimum capital and surplus. In addition to regulatory considerations, management takes into account the overall financial strength of each operating entity before dividends are paid to the Company. Additionally, the amount of dividends the Company's primary life insurance subsidiary can pay is subject to certain tax considerations. In 1993, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") adopted the life and health and property and casualty Risk-Based Capital ("RBC") formulas. These model acts require every insurer to calculate its total adjusted capital and RBC requirement, and provides for an insurance commissioner to intervene if the insurer experiences financial difficulty. These model acts will become law in Ohio, the Company's insurance subsidiaries' state of domicile, in March, 1996. The formula includes components for asset risk, liability risk, interest rate exposure, and other factors. Each of the Company's insurance subsidiaries exceed all required RBC levels as of December 31, 1995. The tax considerations related to the life insurance subsidiary restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid without incurring a tax. At December 31, 1995, the Company's life insurance subsidiary could pay an aggregate of $2,549,000 from shareholders' surplus without incurring a tax. At December 31, 1995, any amounts to be paid from the life and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries would require regulatory approval. For information regarding certain federal income tax limitations on dividends, see "Note G" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES In 1982 the Company incorporated Dublin International Limited ("Dublin"), an exempted Island of Nevis domiciled company. Dublin is a wholly- owned subsidiary of ACCEL. In 1986 Acceleration Insurance Company, Ltd. ("AICL"), a wholly-owned subsidiary organized by ACCEL and domiciled in the United Kingdom, received approval from regulatory authorities to commence operations. From mid-1986 through 1992, AICL offered specialty casualty products in the United Kingdom. The assets and results of operations of these subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 1995 are not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements. See "Note M" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 1995, the Company redeemed most of its shares of AICL, which resulted in proceeds approximating the Company's original investment in AICL. The transaction was approved by the Department of Trade and Insurance (United Kingdom). On February 7, 1996, the Company received the final proceeds for redemption of its remaining shares, and AICL ceased to exist. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Since July 1981 the Company's executive offices have been located at 475 Metro Place North, Dublin, Ohio. The four- story office building has been owned by ALIC and consists of approximately 80,000 square feet of office space. The industry segments as identified in "Note J" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements most recently utilized approximately 30,000 square feet of the building. Approximately 45,000 square feet had been leased to unaffiliated parties through year-end 1995. The remaining 5,000 square feet remained available for lease. See "Note R" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On March 21, 1996, the building was sold by ALIC for a price of $3.5 million. The Company will remain in the building and occupy approximately 16,000 square feet of home office space under a five-year lease at an annual rental of approximately $256,000. In late 1995 the Company began renting approximately 6,000 square feet of office space in Stafford, Texas, to house its executive offices. The annual rental on the five-year lease approximates $70,000. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Not applicable. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS Not applicable. PART II ITEM 5.

These prices have been adjusted for common stock dividends and do not include retail mark-up, mark-down, or commissions and do not always necessarily represent actual transactions. 1995 High Low 1994 High Low ---- ---- --- ---- ---- --- 4th Quarter $3.875 $2.375 4th Quarter $3.125 $1.750 3rd Quarter 4.875 2.750 3rd Quarter 3.750 2.250 2nd Quarter 3.125 2.000 2nd Quarter 5.000 3.000 1st Quarter 2.875 1.750 1st Quarter 6.000 3.750 (b) The approximate number of holders of record of ACCEL's common stock ($.10 par value) as of January 31, 1996, was 638 holders. (c) Dividends paid on common stock: 1994 - -0- per share 1995 - -0- per share Restrictions on present or future ability to pay dividends: The Senior Notes issued December 29, 1995 (See Note D in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) contain certain covenants which restrict the payment of dividends to not more than 50% of the cumulative consolidated net income for the period from and after January 1, 1996 to and including the date of making the dividend payment. Since June 1992, ACCEL's Board of Directors suspended payment of cash dividends on the common stock until the Company returns to a level of profitability which will sustain such payments. ITEM 6.

The inclusion of common stock equivalents (options) would not be dilutive.    The 1995, 1994 and 1993 data reflects the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Statement No. 113, "Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long- Duration Contracts" ("Statement No. 113"). ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 The loss before income taxes and other items for 1995 was $1,101,000. This loss was primarily driven by three factors: Foremost was adverse loss development on discontinued property and casualty products. This adverse development aggregated $2,400,000 which included a $1,200,000 year end reserve increase on the discontinued realtors' errors and omissions product. This adverse development was partially offset by a $500,000 favorable development on the discontinued medical business. The second factor was the incurral of legal fees related to the E&O program litigation during 1995, including the Company's legal action against the entities involved in the E&O program. These actions caused the incurral of legal fees of $550,000 in 1995. The Company was awarded $5.1 million against the marketing organization involved in the E&O program. No amounts have been received by the Company on its judgment and therefore the award has not been reflected in the 1995 consolidated statement of operations. Lastly, during 1995 the Company incurred approximately $350,000 in severance expenses related to departed employees. The loss before income taxes and other items for 1994 was $4,905,000. A significant portion of the 1994 loss is related to the write off of Galaxy ($3,829,000) and Galaxy's first quarter loss ($205,000), or a total Galaxy loss of $4,034,000. In addition, several discontinued property and casualty lines continued to show adverse loss development in 1994, partially offset by positive results from the credit and extended service contract product lines. The loss before income taxes and other items for 1993 was $5,626,000. The 1993 loss is primarily attributable to adverse loss development related to Galaxy's lines of business and several discontinued lines of medical and property and casualty business. The net underwriting losses and overhead in 1993 for these product lines were approximately; $3.1 million for Galaxy, $1.7 million for discontinued medical lines and $1.0 million for discontinued property and casualty lines. In addition, the Company wrote off the remaining goodwill ($1.6 million) associated with the original acquisition of Galaxy. Partially offsetting these losses were gains of $1.7 million and $300,000 related to two of the Company's core product lines, credit insurance and extended service contracts, respectively. The Company made concerted efforts in the last three years to reduce general and administrative expenses. Staffing has been reduced by 20%, 26% and 43% in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. These expense control initiatives have allowed the Company to concentrate on its traditional profit producing lines of business (credit insurance and extended service contracts) and to begin programs in selected Property & Casualty lines in which the current management team has experience and expertise. The primary causes for the fluctuation in operating income (loss) before income taxes discussed above are easily identified by comparing policy benefits (claims, loss and loss adjustment expenses) to premiums earned. Except for general and administrative expenses, the remaining items are at expected levels based upon premium levels and product mix. See Table I on page 14. REVENUE Gross premium writings for 1995 were $55.4 million compared to $60.5 million for 1994. The decrease in 1995 was primarily the result of decreases in premium levels related to discontinued lines of business. See Table II on page 15. Gross premium writings for 1994 were $60.5 million compared to $95.8 million for 1993. The decrease in 1994 can be attributed to the following: vendor's single interest declined $13.1 million, medical products declined $8.7 million, discontinued property and casualty lines declined $3.4 million and Galaxy declined $12.4 million. As noted in Table II, there was approximately $5.5 million of return premium related to the VSI program. This was the result of entering into assumption reinsurance treaties with unaffiliated reinsurance companies, whereby the reinsurers assumed the in force unearned premium reserve and related claim liabilities. Since the profit margin on this line of business was minimal, the effect of this transaction had no material effect on the statements of operations for the periods presented. The credit and extended service contract products increased in 1994 by $2.4 million when compared to 1993. The Company has also experienced decreases in net investment income, excluding realized gains, since 1993. These decreases were caused by a decrease in invested assets due primarily to the run off of discontinued lines of business. The Company plans to concentrate its efforts on growing the credit, extended service contract and the newly introduced program product lines. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company's cash flows from operations have generally been adequate for its current operating needs. Cash flows from operating activities in 1995 were adversely impacted by the reinsurance transaction dated December 29, 1995 described in Note F in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's credit insurance policy terms and related liabilities are generally limited to a four-year period during which the consumer makes payments on the loan. The Company's liability on extended service contracts typically extends for either one-year or five-year periods. The Company, therefore, maintains liquidity in its investment portfolio to correspond with the liability outstanding on its lines of business. At December 31, 1995, the average maturity of investments in debt securities was approximately 4.8 years to the nearest call date. The Company's available for sale fixed maturity securities at December 31, 1995 include $26.9 million of mortgage-backed securities and $13.7 million of asset-backed collateralized securities. The mortgage and asset-backed securities are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments. As such, those securities may have a different actual maturity and yield than planned at the time of purchase. The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between its amortized cost and par value, relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages to prepayment risk in a changing interest rate environment and relative priority of the securities in the overall securitization. The Company limits the extent of its risks on fixed maturity securities by generally avoiding securities whose cost significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities which are backed by stable collateral, and by concentrating on securities that are either planned amortization or sequential pay classes. The collateralized mortgage obligations and asset backed securities owned have primarily short to intermediate average lives. At December 31, 1995, the Company did not have a significant amount of higher risk mortgage or asset backed securities. There are negligible default risks on the mortgage and asset backed security portfolio as a whole as the vast majority of the assets are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored entities or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status. Ohio domiciled insurance companies are subject to Ohio law which regulates the ability of insurance companies to pay dividends. The regulation limits the annual dividend or distribution of an insurer to the greater of (1) net income of the previous year or (2) 10% of unassigned surplus as of the end of the previous year. In addition, all dividends must come from earned surplus to qualify as a non-extraordinary dividend. Amounts greater than this would be considered extraordinary dividends and could not be paid without permission of the Department of Insurance of the State of Ohio ("Ohio Department"). Based on this regulation, ALIC could pay a dividend of $8,000 and ANIC would require Ohio Department approval to pay any dividend to the registrant during 1996. The Company's cash flow projections for 1996 assume that certain events will take place in order to have sufficient cash to meet its debt service and other requirements. These events include the liquidation of AICL. The liquidation was in fact concluded in the first quarter of 1996. The Company will monitor its current and future debt service requirements to coincide with cash flow availability as well as explore various capital raising alternatives. The Company intends to use any proceeds from a judgement entered in its favor in a legal proceeding (see CERTAIN EVENTS) to repay $3,700,000 in advances received in 1992 and 1993 from the registrant's subsidiaries which are eliminated in consolidation. In July 1991, ACCEL issued $5,848,000 of subordinated notes (the "Subordinated Notes") in connection with the purchase of all outstanding common shares of RGL. See "Note K" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Subordinated Notes have a nine-year term with no principal payable until maturity, and bear interest at 10.125% per annum. Effective June 30, 1992, ACCEL amended the notes to permit the issuance of additional notes for the purpose of making interest payments, provided, however, that ACCEL could at its option pay cash in lieu of issuing additional notes in any denomination of less than $1,000. As a result, ACCEL issued additional notes totaling $569,000 and $515,000 for the 1995 and 1994 interest payments, respectively. Of the Subordinated Notes described above, $5,371,000 were initially issued to Ranger Insurance Company ("Ranger"), a company related through common ownership by a stockholder and director of the Company. In 1993, Ranger sold all of the subordinated notes held by it to Chase Insurance Holdings Corporation ("CIHC"). Additional Subordinated Notes in the amount of $506,000 and $458,000 were issued to related parties for the 1995 and 1994 interest payments, respectively. The total outstanding Subordinated Notes were $6,031,000 and $5,462,000 ($5,347,000 and $4,841,000 held by related parties at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively) and the fair value of these notes approximated $5,783,000 and $5,237,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. At December 31, 1994, the Company had an outstanding loan balance of $13,000,000 under the terms of a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a bank, and the effective interest rate was 6.25%. During 1993, the Company did not meet all the requirements contained in the various financial tests under the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. On March 30, 1994, the bank and the Company agreed to a waiver of certain covenants of the Credit Agreement such that the Company would not be in default at December 31, 1993 and through January 1, 1995. Proceeds from the Credit Agreement were partially used in the purchase of RGL, and to fund general operating activities. During September 1994, the revolving loans under the Credit Agreement were converted to a $13,000,000 term loan, payable in full on September 23, 1998. At December 31, 1994, the effective interest rate and outstanding loan balance were 8.75% and $13,000,000, respectively. The fair value of this term loan approximated $13,000,000 at December 31, 1994. On February 7, 1995 the Company renegotiated the terms of its Credit Agreement. Under the amended Credit Agreement, the quarterly principal payments scheduled to begin in 1995 were waived. Specific principal payments totaling up to $1.5 million were due on June 30, 1995 and December 31, 1995, respectively, from the liquidation of AICL and the projected sale of the building used as the corporate home office. The loan was to be payable in full on June 30, 1997. The Credit Agreement also required that during the period the loan was outstanding, the Company had to maintain consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement. At December 31, 1994, required tangible net worth was $13,000,000. At December 31, 1994, the Company's consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, was $14,438,000. On December 29, 1995, the Company issued new senior notes (the "Senior Notes") totaling $16,500,000 at 9.50%, maturing on April 1, 2001. The proceeds from these notes were used to retire the loan outstanding under the aforementioned Credit Agreement and to liquidate an intercompany loan between ACCEL and an insurance subsidiary. In addition, as of January 1, 1996 ALIC entered into a reinsurance agreement with an unaffiliated company to reinsure its in-force Credit Business. This agreement is structured, such, that as future profits emerge on this block of business, a substantial portion of the Company's share of the profits will be used over the next four to five years to pay the interest thereon and redeem these Senior Notes. ACCEL's Board of Directors approved an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") during 1989. In 1990, the ESOP entered into an agreement with ALIC to borrow up to $1,000,000 for the purchase of ACCEL's common stock. Company contributions into the ESOP have been used to pay down the loan from ALIC and release shares into the participants' accounts as the Company's matching contribution. The ESOP purchased 136,887 shares (adjusted for the 1990 5% common stock dividend) under this loan agreement with ALIC at a cost of $1,000,000. In addition to the shares purchased under the loan agreement, the ESOP purchased 90,088 common shares at a cost of $603,000. The loan bears interest at 10%. At December 31, 1995, the loan had an unpaid balance of $525,239. The market value of the underlying shares was $161,000. The Company has revalued this loan to market value as of December 31, 1995. This will allow the release of shares to participants' accounts at an average price which more closely approximates recent market values on the Company's stock. The decrease in the loan has been reflected through a decrease in additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The unpaid balance of the loan ($161,000 at December 31, 1995) has been reflected as a reduction in common stockholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company incurred ESOP contribution expenses of $198,000, $178,000 and $160,000, respectively. During November 1989, ACCEL's Board of Directors also approved a stock buy back program to purchase up to 1,000,000 common shares in open market purchases. As of December 31, 1995, ACCEL had purchased 229,185 shares at a cost of $1,722,000 under this program. The buy back program had been funded from internal funds. No shares have been purchased since 1992. The Company currently has two business lines that are in run-off status: the realtors' errors and omissions line and the farmowner's multi-peril and ancillary inland marine products. Also, for information regarding Galaxy, see "Note K" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates for policy reserves are continually under review and adjusted as necessary, and as experience develops or new information becomes known, such adjustments are included in current operations. These liabilities are necessarily subject to the impact of future changes in claim severity, frequency and other factors. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, based on recent evaluations conducted by experienced consultants and internal reviews, management believes that the current level of policy reserves will be adequate to cover anticipated claim liabilities. However, because the realtors' errors and omission risk was written from the first quarter 1986 through the first quarter of 1991; and considering the length of time involved in the settlement of some claims, there remains a lack of credible experience needed to determine whether actual incurred policy benefits will conform to the assumptions inherent in the determination of these liabilities. Accordingly, the ultimate amounts required for settlement of policy benefits may vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has reviewed FASB Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" which becomes effective in 1996. The Company has also reviewed FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" which becomes effective in 1996. The Company does not expect the impact of either of these FASB Statements to be material to the financial condition of the Company. Although the cumulative effects of inflation on premium growth cannot be fully determined, increases in the retail price of automobiles have generally resulted in increased amounts being financed which constitute the basis of premiums charged for credit insurance. Anticipated increases in automobile repairs also provides the primary basis for increases in extended service contract premium rates. CERTAIN EVENTS AUTO LOAN INDEMNITY: The Company was one of multiple defendants in a lawsuit which was settled in early 1994 in state court in Orange County, California, involving the loan loss indemnity product marketed from 1986 through 1988. The Company had previously settled with numerous other plaintiffs by a return of applicable premium. The Company's accrued reserves for this litigation were adequate to cover final settlement costs in 1994. WRITE OFF OF INVESTMENT IN RGL AND GALAXY: During December 1986, ACCEL invested $1,370,000 (a 20% interest) in RGL. RGL was formed to acquire all the outstanding shares of Galaxy Reinsurance Company, the name was ultimately changed to Galaxy. Galaxy was writing commercial property insurance, property and casualty, and assumed treaty reinsurance. During the second quarter of 1991, the Company purchased 11,000 additional common shares of RGL at a cost of $992,000. The additional investment increased the Company's ownership to 31% at June 30, 1991. In July 1991, the Company purchased the remaining 69% of RGL for cash and subordinated notes (see "Note D" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) of $2.1 million and $5.8 million, respectively. The purchase price included goodwill of $1.2 million. Members of CIHC held a 45% interest in RGL prior to the acquisition by ACCEL. For the three years ended December 31, 1993, RGL recorded losses and Galaxy's underwriting results deteriorated. The statutory capital and surplus of Galaxy declined significantly (from $7.3 million to $6.1 million to $2.9 million at December 31, 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively), resulting in the New York Department of Insurance ("New York Department") placing a moratorium on all new business as of February 28, 1994. As a result of the unsatisfactory underwriting performance of Galaxy and the moratorium placed on Galaxy's underwriting operations by the New York Department, the Company elected to write-off the unamortized goodwill related to Galaxy, which resulted in a charge to operations (general and administrative expenses) for 1993 of $1,643,000. Due to significant loss development during 1994 on Galaxy's liability lines of business, the Company contracted with an independent actuarial consultant to review the adequacy of Galaxy's loss and LAE reserves as of June 30, 1994. The findings of this review indicated the need for additional reserves which resulted in the statutory insolvency of Galaxy at June 30, 1994. Statutory capital and surplus after the reserve strengthening was a negative $2.3 million. Due to the significance of the statutory loss and the loss of the Company's control of Galaxy as a result of the insolvency, the Company wrote off its investment in RGL ($3.8 million) during the second quarter of 1994. As a result of this action, the consolidated results of operations for 1994 include a charge to operations of $3.8 million, representing the Company's net investment in Galaxy as of April 1, 1994, in addition to operating losses of $205,000 incurred during the first quarter. The Company wrote down its investment in RGL to zero and deconsolidated RGL as of April 1, 1994. Pursuant to an Order of Liquidation dated October 7, 1994, issued by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, the Liquidation Bureau of the New York Department took control of Galaxy on October 11, 1994. ANIC, in the normal course of business, issued certain policy endorsements on Galaxy policies in 1992, some of which had pending claims open at the time of liquidation. Management believes that these endorsements will not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition. As of December 31, 1995, ANIC had not incurred any costs related to these endorsements. DISCONTINUED REALTORS' ERRORS AND OMISSIONS PROGRAM: As a result of the losses sustained in the realtors' errors and omissions program, and in particular, conduct discovered by the Company after it assumed responsibility for claims processing and handling, the Company filed suit in November 1991 against the non-affiliated marketing organization and broker involved in the program. The lawsuit sought to recover funds improperly withdrawn from the account established for the payment of claims under the program; for damages due to business expenses improperly charged against such funds; and for improper administration of the program. ACCEL and ANIC entered into an arrangement whereby ANIC's rights under the lawsuit were transferred to the Company in exchange for a $4,000,000 collateral loan issued to ANIC which was recorded as a capital contribution. The transaction and related agreements were approved by the Ohio Department. The loan agreement and accompanying promissory note called for interest at the 13 week Treasury Bill rate plus 100 basis points. The principal of $4,000,000 was paid in full on December 29, 1995. ACCEL pursued the litigation vigorously and in late 1995 ANIC was awarded $5.3 million in damages with $5.1 million thereof being obtained against the marketing organization. A settlement has been reached with the broker defendant, however, the remaining defendant has indicated its intention to appeal the verdict. The Company is aggressively pursuing efforts to collect on the remaining judgement.

In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedules as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 1995, as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note D to the consolidated financial statements, on March 30, 1994, the Company and its principal lender agreed to waive compliance with certain loan agreement covenants through January 1, 1995. On February 7, 1995 the Company and the lender again renegotiated the credit agreement and certain of the covenants. The amended agreement stated that the loan was payable in full on June 30, 1997. On December 29, 1995, the Company issued senior notes with a different lender and retired the aforementioned credit agreement. The most recent loan agreement requires that during the period the loan is outstanding, the Company maintain consolidated tangible net worth, as defined. At December 31, 1995, required tangible net worth was $15,000,000 and the Company's consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, was $19,738,000. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ACCEL International Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 1995, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. /S/ KPMG Peat Marwick LLP ------------------------- KPMG Peat Marwick LLP Columbus, Ohio March 15, 1996 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS Stockholders and Board of Directors ACCEL International Corporation: We have audited the consolidated financial statements of ACCEL International Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) for the year ended December 31, 1993, as listed in the accompanying index to financial statements (Item 14(a)). In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedules as of December 31, 1993 and for the year then ended, as listed in the accompanying index. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. As more fully described in "Note D", at December 31, 1993, the Company did not meet all the requirements of certain covenants contained in a loan agreement with its principal lender. On March 30, 1994, the Company and the lender agreed to waive compliance with these covenants at December 31, 1993 and through January 1, 1995. The loan agreement also requires that during the period the loan is outstanding, the Company maintain consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreement. At December 31, 1993, required tangible net worth was $27,500,000. At December 31, 1993, the Company's consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, was $27,549,000. In our opinion, the financial statements of ACCEL International Corporation and subsidiaries listed in the accompanying index to financial statements (Item 14(a)) present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993 NOTE A-- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The accompanying consolidated financial statements of ACCEL International Corporation ("ACCEL") and subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which, as to the insurance company subsidiaries, differ in some respects from statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by state insurance departments. The significant accounting policies followed by the Company that materially affect financial reporting are summarized below. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ACCEL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, except for Randjill Group Ltd. ("RGL") (see Note K). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: ACCEL is an insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware in June 1978 as the successor to an Ohio corporation, formerly Acceleration Corporation, organized in 1969. The Company has been engaged in the sale and underwriting of credit life and credit accident and health insurance, extended service contracts, vendor's single interest and other specialty casualty products. The credit insurance and extended service contract products continue to be offered to consumers, principally through automobile dealers, financial institutions and other business entities. The Company is subject to competition from other insurers throughout the states in which it writes business. The Company is also subject to regulation by the Insurance Departments of states in which it is licensed, and undergoes periodic examinations by those departments. The following is a description of the most significant risks facing life and health and property/casualty insurers and how the Company mitigates those risks: LEGAL/REGULATORY RISK is the risk that changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which an insurer operates will create additional expenses not anticipated by the insurer in pricing its products. That is, regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits, new legal theories or insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments may create costs for the insurer beyond those currently recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The Company mitigates this risk by operating throughout the United States, thus reducing its exposure to any single jurisdiction, and also by employing underwriting and loss adjusting practices which identify and minimize the adverse impact of this risk. CREDIT RISK is the risk that issuers of securities owned by the Company will default or that other parties, including reinsurers, which owe the Company money, will not pay. The Company minimizes this risk by adhering to a conservative investment strategy, by maintaining sound reinsurance and credit and collection policies and by providing for any amounts deemed uncollectible. INTEREST RATE RISK is the risk that interest rates will change and cause a decrease in the value of an insurer's investments. The Company mitigates this risk by attempting to match the maturity schedule of its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities. To the extent that liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature, an insurer would have to borrow funds or sell assets prior to maturity and potentially recognize a gain or loss. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES: In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE A-- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--(CONTINUED) The most significant estimates include those used in determining deferred policy acquisition costs and the liability for unearned premium reserves and insurance claims. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are adequate. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary. Such adjustments are generally reflected in current operations. INVESTMENTS: The Company classifies all of its fixed maturity and equity securities as available for sale, therefore these securities are carried at fair value and the unrealized appreciation or depreciation is reported as a separate component of common stockholders' equity after giving effect to applicable income taxes. Short-term investments which include U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit are carried at cost which approximates fair value. Other invested assets are carried at cost which approximates fair value. Realized gains and losses on the disposal of investments are determined by specific identification and are included in the consolidated statements of operations. When an other than temporary decline in value is recognized, the specific investment is carried at estimated realizable value and its original book value is reduced to reflect such impairment of the investment. Such reductions in book value are reflected in realized investment losses for the period in which they were written down. For mortgage backed securities, the Company's accounting follows the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Tasks Force ("EITF") Consensus No. 93-18. This EITF requires that when the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at a risk-free rate of return is less than the cost basis of the investment an impairment loss is to be recognized by writing the investment down to its fair value. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. These techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Although fair value estimates are calculated using assumptions that management believes are appropriate, changes in assumptions could cause these estimates to vary materially. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in the immediate settlement of the instruments. The disclosure requirements related to financial instruments exclude certain assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The tax ramifications of the related unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, short-term investments, accrued investment income, premiums in process of transmittal, and amounts due from reinsurers approximate their fair value. Fair value for fixed maturity, equity and mortgage backed securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments at amortized value. The fair value of notes payable is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on ACCEL's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE A-- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--(CONTINUED) DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS: The costs (principally commissions and certain expenses of policy issuance) of acquiring or renewing insurance business, all of which vary with and are directly related to the production of business, have been deferred. These deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized in a manner related to the recognition of premiums earned. Substantially all such deferred costs are amortized within a four-year period. Anticipated investment income is considered in determining recoverability of deferred costs. EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION: Equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over an estimated useful asset life of five years. PROPERTY OCCUPIED BY COMPANY: Home office property is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over an estimated life of thirty-five years. GOODWILL AMORTIZATION: Cost in excess of fair value of net assets of subsidiaries at dates of acquisition is being amortized primarily over a thirty-five year period. It is the Company's policy to account for goodwill at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. On an ongoing basis, management reviews the valuation and amortization of its goodwill. As a part of its ongoing review, management estimates the fair value of the Company's goodwill, taking into consideration any events and circumstances which might have diminished fair value. Believing such an event and circumstance had occurred in 1993, management reduced the carrying amount of its goodwill at December 31, 1993 by $1.6 million. See Note K regarding the write down of goodwill. PREMIUM INCOME RECOGNITION AND UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES: Unearned premium reserves on credit life and credit accident and health insurance are calculated primarily under the "Rule of 78's Method", which method results in premium income being recognized in decreasing proportions over the terms of the policies, which approximates the pattern of policy benefits incurred. Unearned premium reserves on the extended service contracts are based on the historical emergence pattern of claims. The Company's primary liability on new car contracts exists subsequent to the expiration of manufacturers' warranties. This method results in premium being recognized in direct proportion to the emergence of benefits on these contracts. Unearned premium reserves on property and casualty products are calculated on the pro rata method. INSURANCE CLAIMS: The liabilities for insurance claims are determined using statistical analyses and represent estimates of the ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported claims that are unpaid at year end. Considerable variability is inherent in such estimates and actual results will likely differ from those estimates. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: ACCEL and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The provision for income taxes is based on income for financial reporting purposes, after permanent differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under this method, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE A--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--(CONTINUED) REINSURANCE: Reinsurance premiums ceded and reinsurance recoveries on policy benefits incurred are deducted from the respective income and expense accounts. Assets and liabilities related to reinsurance ceded are reported on a gross basis. Amounts related to reinsurance contracts, where it is not reasonably possible for the reinsurer to realize a significant loss, are recorded based on the deposit accounting method. DEFERRED REINSURANCE COMMISSIONS: Commissions and ceding fees received in connection with premiums ceded are deferred and amortized in a manner related to the recognition of premiums earned. Substantially all such commissions and ceding fees are amortized within a four-year period. Earned ceding fees, commissions and claims recovered are reported as reinsurance expense recoveries in the consolidated statements of operations. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: Net income and net loss per common share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The inclusion of common stock equivalents (options) would not be dilutive. RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain amounts in the 1994 and 1993 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the 1995 presentation. NOTE B--INVESTMENTS At December 31, 1995 and 1994, investments in cash and securities with a carrying value of $9,108,000 and $8,428,000, respectively, were on deposit with state insurance departments to satisfy regulatory requirements. Cash and securities with a carrying value of $19,879,000 and $39,710,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, were on deposit in security funds in connection with reinsurance treaties.

Mortgage-backed securities owned have an expected weighted average maturity of over 5 years. Proceeds from the sale of securities available-for-sale during 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $45,531,000, $26,283,000 and $66,083,000, respectively. Gross gains of $713,000 ($342,000 in 1994 and $1,520,000 in 1993) and gross losses of $284,000 ($35,000 in 1994 and $184,000 in 1993) were realized on those sales. NOTE C--STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND TRANSFER LIMITATIONS Generally, the net assets of the consolidated insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to ACCEL are limited to the amounts that the insurance subsidiaries' net assets, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices, exceed minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements; however, payments of such amounts as dividends from each insurance subsidiary are currently subject to regulation by Ohio law. Based on this law, ALIC could pay a dividend of $8,000 and ANIC would require Ohio Department approval to pay any dividend to the registrant during 1996. At December 31, 1995, $18,047,000 of net assets, as determined in accordance with prescribed and permitted statutory accounting practices, of the consolidated insurance subsidiaries are available for transfer, subject to regulatory approval, in the form of dividends, loans or advances to ACCEL (total statutory net assets of the consolidated insurance subsidiaries was $23,047,000 at December 31, 1995). The statutory basis capital and surplus and net income (loss) of the consolidated insurance subsidiaries, as reported to insurance regulatory authorities, are summarized as follows: Life/ Property/ Health Casualty ------ -------- (Thousands of dollars) Statutory capital and surplus at December 31: 1995 $13,010 $10,037 1994 13,841 14,190 Statutory net income (loss) for year ended December 31: 1995 $ (713) $(2,574) 1994 1,165 (1,537) 1993 219 (3,503) NOTE D--NOTES PAYABLE In July 1991, ACCEL issued $5,848,000 of subordinated notes (the "Subordinated Notes") in connection with the purchase of all outstanding common shares of RGL (see Note K). The Subordinated Notes have a nine-year term with no principal payable until maturity, and bear interest at 10.125% per annum. Effective June 30, 1992, ACCEL amended the notes to permit the issuance of additional notes for the purpose of making interest payments, provided, however, that ACCEL may at its option pay cash in lieu of issuing additional notes in any denomination of less than $1,000. As a result, ACCEL issued additional notes totaling $569,000 and $515,000 for the 1995 and 1994 interest payments, respectively. Of the Subordinated Notes described above, $5,371,000 were initially issued to Ranger Insurance Company ("Ranger"), a company related through common ownership by a stockholder and director of the Company. In 1993, Ranger sold all of the Subordinated Notes held by it to Chase Insurance Holdings Corporation ("CIHC"), another company related through common ownership by a stockholder and director of the Company. Additional Subordinated Notes in the amount of $506,000 and $458,000 were issued to related parties for the 1995 and 1994 interest payments, respectively. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE D-- NOTES PAYABLE--(CONTINUED) The total outstanding Subordinated Notes were $6,031,000 and $5,462,000 ($5,347,000 and $4,841,000 held by related parties at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively) and the fair value of these notes approximated $5,783,000 and $5,237,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. At December 31, 1994, the Company had an outstanding loan balance of $13,000,000 under the terms of a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a bank, and the effective interest rate was 6.25%. During 1993, the Company did not meet all of the requirements contained in the various financial tests under the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. On March 30, 1994, the bank and the Company agreed to a waiver of certain covenants of the Credit Agreement such that the Company would not be in default at December 31, 1993 and through January 1, 1995. Proceeds from the Credit Agreement were partially used in the purchase of RGL, and to fund general operating activities. During September 1994, the revolving loans under the Credit Agreement were converted to a $13,000,000 term loan, payable in full on September 23, 1998. At December 31, 1994, the effective interest rate and outstanding loan balance were 8.75% and $13,000,000, respectively. The fair value of this term loan approximated $13,000,000 at December 31, 1994. On February 7, 1995 the Company renegotiated the terms of the Credit Agreement. Under the amended Credit Agreement, the quarterly principal payments scheduled to begin in 1995 were waived. Specific principal payments totaling up to $1.5 million were due on June 30, 1995 and December 31, 1995, respectively, from the liquidation of Acceleration Insurance Company Limited ("AICL"), a United Kingdom subsidiary, and the projected sale of the building used as the corporate home office. The loan was to be payable in full on June 30, 1997. The Credit Agreement also required that during the period the loan was outstanding, the Company maintain consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the  agreement. At December 31, 1994, required tangible net worth was $13,000,000. At December 31, 1994, the Company's consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, was $14,438,000. On December 29, 1995, the Company issued senior notes (the "Senior Notes") totaling $16,500,000 at 9.50%, maturing on April 1, 2001. The proceeds from these notes were used to retire the loan outstanding under the aforementioned Credit Agreement and to liquidate an intercompany loan between ACCEL and an insurance subsidiary. In addition, as of January 1, 1996, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement with an unaffiliated company to reinsure the in-force Credit Business. This agreement is structured, such, that as future profits emerge on this block of business, the Company's share of the profits will be used over the next four to five years to pay the interest thereon and redeem these Senior Notes. During 1995, 1994 and 1993, ACCEL paid interest on notes of $1,125,000, $974,000 and $924,000, respectively. NOTE E--DEBENTURES PAYABLE At January 1, 1994, ACCEL had $900,000 principal amount of sinking fund debentures outstanding bearing interest at 10 1/2% and maturing on September 1, 1994. These debentures were fully paid in 1994. During 1994 and 1993, ACCEL paid interest on these debentures of $63,000 and $151,000, respectively, and made mandatory sinking fund payments of $900,000 and $800,000 during 1994 and 1993, respectively. NOTE F--REINSURANCE The Company's reinsurance program includes an agreement covering certain of its direct credit business, the reinsurance of other direct business ceded on a quota share basis and direct business ceded to producer-owned reinsurance companies. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE F-- REINSURANCE--(CONTINUED) The ceding of insurance through reinsurance agreements does not discharge the primary liability of the original underwriter to the insured, but it is the practice of insurers to treat risks that have been reinsured with other companies, to the extent of the reinsurance, as though they were not risks for which the original insurer is liable. Should the reinsurer not be able to meet its obligations, those obligations are the ultimate responsibility of the Company. Therefore, in financial statement presentation, premiums and policy benefits are presented net of that portion of risks reinsured with other companies. DIRECT BUSINESS CEDED--CREDIT BUSINESS QUOTA SHARE: The Company has an agreement in place which covers a substantial portion of its credit insurance business. The agreement contains an experience adjustment computation that results in the ultimate cost of this agreement being a stated percentage related to the business covered by the agreement. The Company ultimately retains a substantial part of the insurance risk, the underwriting income or loss and the investment income on net funds, all of which are retained by the Company. The Company determined that deposit accounting is the appropriate method of accounting for this agreement since it is not reasonably possible for the reinsurer to realize a significant loss from the transaction. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on this basis. The other effect of this agreement is to increase statutory capital and surplus of Acceleration Life Insurance Company ("ALIC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of ACCEL, by $14,512,000 and $15,740,000 as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. On January 1, 1996 the Company terminated this quota share reinsurance agreement and elected to recapture the liabilities subject to this treaty. The liabilities recaptured thereunder were then available for cession under the treaty described below. The unearned premium reserves and claim liabilities recaptured were $29,753,000 and $8,424,000, respectively. Concurrent with this termination, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement with a different unaffiliated reinsurer (which is also the buyer of the Senior Notes discussed in Note D) to reinsure a substantial portion of the in-force credit life and accident and health insurance business, including the amounts recaptured. This agreement is structured in such a way that as future profits emerge on this block of business, a substantial portion of the Company's share of the profits will be used over the next four to five years to pay fees and interest to the reinsurer and redeem the new Senior Notes of $16,500,000. In connection with this agreement, approximately $40,000,000 of assets were transferred to the reinsurer on December 29, 1995, as agreed to by all parties. The unearned premium reserves and liability for insurance claims subject to cession under this treaty approximates $48,616,000 and $9,919,000, respectively, as of January 1, 1996. Prior to December 31, 1995, a security fund had been maintained, primarily comprised of fixed maturities, for the benefit of the reinsurer. Pursuant to the termination of the agreement effective January 1, 1996, as discussed above, certain investments were liquidated from the security fund on December 29, 1995. Proceeds from this liquidation, along with other funds, were transferred on December 29, 1995 to the reinsurer who is party to the agreement dated January 1, 1996. These amounts are included in "Reinsurance Premium Deposits" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 1995. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE F-- REINSURANCE--(CONTINUED) DIRECT BUSINESS CEDED--OTHER QUOTA SHARE: The Company reinsures a portion of its group life and health care insurance with several unaffiliated companies. The effect of this reinsurance is to transfer the risk, the underwriting income or loss, and the investment income related to the premiums ceded. In 1993, the Company entered into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurers related to certain additional product lines. The effect of such reinsurance arrangements is to transfer 100% of the related risk to the reinsurers. Premiums ceded associated with these agreements and included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations amounted to $694,000, $980,000 and $4,588,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. DIRECT BUSINESS CEDED--TO PRODUCER-OWNED REINSURANCE COMPANIES: The Company has agreements to cede certain credit life and credit accident and health insurance to reinsurance companies owned by certain automobile dealers, financial institutions or agents. Under these arrangements, the assuming entities participate in the profits or losses of the insurance produced by them, and the Company may retain a nominal percentage of the applicable business. These treaties generally provide that the Company receives a ceding fee and is reimbursed for certain commissions and claims. Written premiums included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations that have been ceded, or which are subject to cession under all such agreements, amounted to $7,429,000, $10,284,000 and $8,855,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. OTHER REINSURANCE: Credit life and credit accident and health premiums assumed by the Company relating to business written in Pennsylvania by an unaffiliated carrier, amounted to $6,308,000, $7,640,000 and $7,154,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Unearned premium reserves and the liability for insurance claims at December 31, 1995 include $10,904,000 and $3,243,000, respectively ($11,460,000 and $3,208,000 at December 31, 1994, respectively), for risks assumed under this agreement. As of December 31, 1992, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement with unaffiliated reinsurers whereby the Company cedes 100% of the premiums written in connection with vendor's single interest insurance. In mid 1994, a substantial part of the remaining in-force business was assumed by an unaffiliated reinsurer, and resulted in a return of premiums. The VSI product was forced- placed when the borrower could not demonstrate coverage for the automobile that was securing the loan with the lending institution. Premiums ceded under this agreement were $(858,000), $(6,024,000) and $6,082,000 for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Policy benefit expense in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, has been reduced by $104,000, $1,407,000 and $3,081,000 in conjunction with these agreements. The Company also entered into reinsurance agreements with several unaffiliated reinsurers related to certain property and casualty lines of business written by the Company. Unearned premium reserves and the liability for insurance claims associated with these agreements at December 31, 1995 are $2,645,000 and $2,240,000, respectively ($6,242,000 and $889,000 at December 31, 1994, respectively). The following data summarizes certain aspects of the Company's reinsurance activity for 1995, 1994 and 1993. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE F--REINSURANCE--(CONTINUED) Premiums written and earned in 1995, 1994 and 1993 are summarized as follows: 1995 1994 1993 Written Earned Written Earned Written Earned -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- (In thousands) Direct $ 49,135 $ 50,265 $ 52,864 $ 59,789 $ 87,546 $ 78,773 Assumed 6,308 6,864 7,640 7,004 8,220 9,309 Ceded (12,147) (16,276) (12,495) (19,193) (30,261) (26,433) -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- Net premiums $ 43,296 $ 40,853 $ 48,009 $ 47,600 $ 65,505 $ 61,649 ======== ======== ======== ======== ======== ======== Policy benefits incurred in 1995, 1994 and 1993 are summarized as follows: 1995 1994 1993 ---- ---- ---- (In thousands) Direct $ 24,900 $ 31,567 $ 44,952 Assumed 3,973 3,754 5,240 Ceded (8,755) (10,324) (11,761) -------- -------- -------- Net policy benefits $ 20,118 $ 24,997 $ 38,431 ======== ======== ======== NOTE G--FEDERAL INCOME TAXES The Company files a consolidated income tax return with its subsidiaries, including its life insurance subsidiary. For tax purposes, certain amounts have been accumulated by the life insurance subsidiary in a memorandum tax account designated as "policyholders' surplus" that will be taxed only when distributed to shareholders. Policyholders' surplus on a tax basis was $4,489,000 at December 31, 1995. Management considers the likelihood of distributions from this account to be remote; therefore, no Federal income tax has been provided for such distributions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 1995, approximately $2,549,000 could be distributed to shareholders before a distribution would be designated as from the policyholders' surplus account. The federal income tax expense for 1995 includes a credit of $11,000 of foreign taxes related to AICL ($41,000 expense in 1994 and $36,000 credit in 1993). In 1995 and 1994, the Company paid $410,000 and $140,000, respectively, in federal income taxes. In 1993 the Company received a refund of $3,910,000 for federal income taxes. Total income tax expense (benefit) differed from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to loss before taxes as follows: ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE G--FEDERAL INCOME TAXES--(CONTINUED) Year Ended December 31, 1995 1994 1993 -------- -------- ---- (Thousands of dollars) Income tax (benefit) at statutory rate $ (374) $ (1,668) $ (1,913) Amortization of goodwill 36 36 605 Dividends-received deduction (54) (38) (37) Special deductions of life insurance subsidiaries - (297) (41) Tax-exempt interest (18) (21) (30) Valuation allowance 66 (1,130) 745 Write off of subsidiary - 1,302 - Benefit of non-life companies not utilized 622 531 - Other, net 81 1,618 326 -------- -------- -------- Federal income tax expense (benefit) $ 359 $ 333 $ (345) ======== ======== ======== The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant components of the net deferred tax liability at December 31, 1995 and 1994 are summarized as follows: December 31 1995 1994 ---- ---- Deferred Tax Liabilities: Deferred policy acquisition costs $ 10,656 $ 10,461 Other 2,621 3,631 -------- -------- 13,277 14,092 -------- -------- Deferred Tax Assets: Deferred reinsurance commissions 5,420 6,149 Net operating loss carryforward 1,370 741 Insurance reserves 1,029 1,231 Unrealized losses on investments 119 2,287 Service contracts 1,757 1,482 Other 95 902 -------- -------- Total deferred tax assets 9,790 12,792 Valuation allowance (1,537) (3,638) -------- -------- Net deferred tax assets 8,253 9,154 -------- -------- Net deferred tax liability $ 5,024 $ 4,938 ======== ======== The Company has determined the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets based on its analysis of future deductible amounts. This analysis included a schedule of the deductibility of nonlife items against life company taxable income pursuant to Section 801 of the Internal Revenue Code and a determination of the realization of losses generated by available for sale securities. The Company had recorded a valuation allowance of $2,484,000 and $1,739,000 as of December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1993, respectively. The Company has $4,028,000 of net operating losses that are available to reduce future income taxes; $479,000, $35,000, $1,229,000 and $2,285,000 of the losses expire in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE H--LIABILITY FOR INSURANCE CLAIMS The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending liability balances for the Company's insurance claims for 1995, 1994 and 1993. RECONCILIATION OF LIABILITY FOR INSURANCE CLAIMS 1995 1994 1993 -------------------------------- (In thousands) Liability for insurance claims at beginning of year $ 23,159 $ 49,919 $ 65,235 Less reinsurance recoverables (5,423) (11,801) (18,521) -------- -------- -------- Net balances at beginning of year 17,736 38,118 46,714 Policy benefits incurred: Policy benefits incurred for events of the current year 19,602 24,914 40,915 Policy benefits incurred for events of prior years 516 83 (2,484) -------- --------- -------- Total policy benefits incurred 20,118 24,997 38,431 -------- --------- -------- Galaxy unpaid losses and LAE at date of write off (see Note K) - 14,325 - Payments: Policy benefits for insured events of the current year 10,860 20,556 30,960 Policy benefits for insured events in prior years 10,097 10,498 16,067 -------- --------- -------- Total payments 20,957 31,054 47,027 -------- --------- -------- Net balances at end of year 16,897 17,736 38,118 Plus reinsurance recoverables 5,864 5,423 11,801 -------- --------- -------- Liability for insurance claims at end of year $ 22,761 $ 23,159 $ 49,919 ======== ========= ======== The table above reflects decreases in the liability for insurance claims resulting from discontinued lines of business and the write off of Galaxy Insurance Company ("Galaxy"), a wholly owned subsidiary of RGL (see Note K). In 1995 and 1994, increases in policy benefits incurred for events of prior years relate to management's reevaluation of discontinued lines of business. In establishing the liability for insurance claims, management considers facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigation. Liabilities are recognized for known claims (including the cost of related litigation) when sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy, and management can reasonably estimate its liability. In addition, liabilities have been established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims. Estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and updated continually. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE I--COMMON STOCKS AND COMMON STOCK OPTIONS On June 2, 1992, the Board of Directors voted to suspend payment of cash dividends on the common stock until the Company returns to a level of profitability that will sustain the payment of cash dividends. ACCEL's Board of Directors approved an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") during 1989. In 1990, the ESOP entered into an agreement with ALIC to borrow up to $1,000,000 for the purchase of ACCEL's common stock. At December 31, 1995, the unpaid balance on this loan was $161,000. During November 1989, ACCEL's Board of Directors also approved a stock buy back program to repurchase up to 1,000,000 common shares in the open market. ACCEL has purchased 229,185 shares at a cost of $1,722,000 under this program. The buy back program was funded from internally generated funds. No shares have been purchased since 1992. During 1982, ACCEL adopted a stock option plan (the "82 Plan") under which shares of common stock are available to eligible officers and key personnel. Under the terms of the 82 Plan, the option price must be at least 100% of the fair market value at the date of grant, and, accordingly, there have been no charges to income resulting from grants. Options were granted at prices ranging from $2.769 to $11.750 per share from April 1982 through April 1992. The options become exercisable after one year of continuous employment in installments of 50% at the end of the first and the second year from the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. A total of 300,000 (349,672 after giving effect to all subsequent stock dividends) shares have been reserved for options under the 82 Plan. The following table summarizes activity under this plan. The 82 Plan 1995 1994 1993 ----------- ---- ---- ---- Options lapsed 44,596 36,660 34,758 Of the 67,401 options outstanding under the 82 Plan at December 31, 1995, 67,401 were exercisable. No additional shares may be granted under the 82 Plan. During 1987, ACCEL adopted the 1987 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "87 Plan"). The 87 Plan provided for incentive stock options with respect to a maximum of 300,000 (347,287 after giving effect to all subsequent stock dividends) shares of common stock of ACCEL prior to the expiration of the 87 Plan in April 1997. During June of 1991, ACCEL's Board of Directors and shareholders approved the First Restatement of the 1987 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Restated Plan"). The Restated Plan replaced the 87 Plan except as to options granted and outstanding under the 87 Plan. The Restated Plan reserved an additional 450,000 shares for key employees and 50,000 shares for non- employee directors. Options may be granted prior to expiration of the Restated Plan covering shares subject to lapsed or terminated options. Of the 539,569 options outstanding under the Restated Plan, 455,819 were exercisable at December 31, 1995. At December 31, 1995, 275,643 shares were reserved for future grants. During May, 1995, two new Key Employees were granted stock options under ACCEL's Restated Plan. Under the terms of their arrangement with ACCEL, both were granted stock options for ACCEL's common stock in lieu of salary for their first year of service. Options for 150,000 shares were granted at an option price per share of $2.125, the fair value of ACCEL's common stock on the date of grant. The options vest immediately and become exercisable one year following the date of grant; however, they would become exercisable immediately upon either a) a change of control of ACCEL, or b) an involuntary termination. The options would be forfeited if employment with ACCEL was voluntarily terminated prior to May 23, 1996. The options lapse five years from the effective date of grant.

There are no intersegment sales. The allocations of certain general expenses and investment income within segments are based on a number of assumptions, and the reported operating results would change if different methods were applied. Depreciation and capital expenditures are not considered material.

AND GALAXY INSURANCE COMPANY During December 1986, ACCEL invested $1,370,000 (a 20% interest) in RGL. RGL was formed to acquire all the outstanding shares of Galaxy Reinsurance Company, the name was ultimately changed to Galaxy, a New York domiciled property and casualty insurance company. Galaxy wrote commercial property insurance, property and casualty, and assumed treaty reinsurance. During the second quarter of 1991, the Company purchased 11,000 additional common shares of RGL at a cost of $992,000. The additional investment increased the Company's ownership to 31% at June 30, 1991. In July 1991, the Company purchased the remaining 69% of RGL for cash and subordinated notes (see Note D) of $2.1 million and $5.8 million, respectively. The purchase price included goodwill of $1.2 million. Members of CIHC held a 45% interest in RGL prior to the acquisition by ACCEL. For the three years ended December 31, 1993, RGL recorded losses and Galaxy's underwriting results deteriorated. The statutory capital and surplus of Galaxy declined significantly (from $7.3 million to $6.1 million to $2.9 million at December 31, 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively), resulting in the New York Department of Insurance ("New York Department") placing a moratorium on all new business as of February 28, 1994. As a result of the unsatisfactory underwriting performance of Galaxy and the moratorium placed on Galaxy's underwriting operations by the New York Department, the Company elected to write-off the unamortized goodwill related to Galaxy, which resulted in a charge to operations (general and administrative expenses) for 1993 of $1,643,000. Due to significant loss development during 1994 on Galaxy's liability lines of business, the Company contracted with an independent actuarial consultant to review the adequacy of Galaxy's loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of June 30, 1994. The findings of this review indicated the need for additional reserves which resulted in the statutory insolvency of Galaxy at June 30, 1994. Statutory capital and surplus after the reserve strengthening was a negative $2.3 million. Due to the significance of the statutory loss and the loss of the Company's control of Galaxy as a result of the insolvency, the Company wrote off its investment in RGL ($3.8 million) during the second quarter of 1994. As a result of this action, the consolidated results of operations for 1994 include a charge to operations of $3.8 million, representing the Company's net investment in Galaxy as of April 1, 1994, in addition to operating losses of $205,000 incurred during the first quarter. The Company wrote its investment in RGL to zero and deconsolidated RGL as of April 1, 1994. Pursuant to an Order of Liquidation dated October 7, 1994, issued by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, the Liquidation Bureau of the New York Department took control of Galaxy on October 11, 1994. Acceleration National Insurance Company ("ANIC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of ACCEL, in the normal course of business, issued certain policy endorsements on Galaxy policies in 1992, some of which had pending claims open at the time of liquidation. Management believes that these endorsements will not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition. As of December 31, 1995, ANIC had not incurred any costs related to these endorsements. NOTE L--RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN The Acceleration Retirement Savings Plan became effective in 1985. During 1989, ACCEL's Board of Directors approved changes to this plan to include an ESOP and concurrently changed the plan name to the "Acceleration Retirement Savings and Stock Ownership Plan" ("PLAN"). For 1993, ACCEL's Board of Directors authorized a contribution to the plan of $160,000. For 1994 and 1995 the Board authorized contributions to the PLAN at a level that would fund a 100% match of the first 6% of each participating employees tax deferred contributions. The Company incurred a contribution expense for 1995, 1994 and 1993 of $198,000, $178,000 and $160,000, respectively. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE L--RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN--(CONTINUED) The PLAN allows all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements and choose to participate to defer a percentage of their salary and contribute to the PLAN on a tax deferred basis. The employee contributions to the PLAN are used to fund the savings element of the PLAN. The Company contributions become part of the Plan and are used to purchase shares of ACCEL's common stock in the open market. In 1990, the PLAN entered into an agreement with ALIC to borrow up to $1,000,000 for the purchase of ACCEL's common stock. The PLAN purchased 136,887 shares (adjusted for the 1990 5% common stock dividend) under this loan agreement with ALIC at a cost of $1,000,000. In addition to the shares purchased under the loan agreement, the Plan has purchased 90,088 common shares at a cost of $603,000. The loan, which bears interest at 10%, is being repaid from Company contributions to the PLAN. At December 31, 1995, the loan had an unpaid balance of $525,000. The market value of the underlying shares was $161,000. The Company has revalued this loan to market value as of December 31, 1995. This will release shares to participants accounts at an average price which more closely approximates recent market values on the Company's stock. The decrease in the loan has been reflected through a decrease in paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The unpaid balance of the loan ($161,000 at December 31, 1995), has been reflected as a reduction in common stockholders' equity. NOTE M--FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND OPERATING RESULTS The financial statements of AICL have been translated into U.S. dollars using the British pound as the functional currency. The balance sheets of AICL have been translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The operating results of AICL have been translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The consolidated results of operations include $(137,000), $(82,000) and $25,000 of pre-tax income (loss) from AICL for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Included in foreign currency translation adjustments are unrealized exchange gains of $85,000 in 1995 and $96,000 in 1994. During 1995, the Company redeemed most of its shares of AICL, which resulted in proceeds approximating the Company's original investment in AICL. The transaction was approved by the Department of Trade and Insurance (United Kingdom). On February 7, 1996, the Company received the final proceeds for redemption of its remaining shares, and AICL ceased to exist. NOTE N-- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Due to the nature of its operations, the Company is at all times subject to pending and threatened legal actions that arise in the normal course of its activities. In management's opinion, based on the advice of outside counsel, the accompanying consolidated financial statements would not be materially affected by the ultimate outcome of any legal proceedings or contingent liabilities. In late 1995, the Company was awarded $5.3 million in damages related to certain litigation involving the discontinued Realtors' Errors and Omissions Program. $5.1 million of this award was obtained against the marketing organization; the remainder against a broker defendant. A settlement has been reached with the broker defendant, however, the remaining defendant has indicated its intention to appeal the verdict. The Company is aggressively pursuing efforts to collect on the remaining judgement. As the judgement is currently under negotiation, no amounts have been recognized in the 1995 consolidated statement of operations. ACCEL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(CONTINUED) NOTE N--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES--(CONTINUED) The Company currently leases office space under an operating lease which expires in 2000.

NOTE P--RISK BASED CAPITAL In 1993, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") adopted the life and health and property and casualty Risk-Based Capital (RBC) formulas. These model acts require every insurer to calculate its total adjusted capital and RBC requirement, and provides for an insurance commissioner to intervene if the insurer experiences financial difficulty. These model acts will become law in Ohio, the Company's insurance subsidiaries' state of domicile, in March, 1996. The formula includes components for asset risk, liability risk, interest rate exposure, and other factors. Each of the Company's insurance subsidiaries exceed all required RBC levels as of December 31, 1995.

ITEM 10 - 13 Page 84 SCHEDULE VII ARBITRATION SCHEDULE To initiate arbitration, either the CEDING COMPANY or the REINSURER shall notify the other party in writing of its desire to arbitrate, stating the nature of its dispute and the remedy sought. The party to which the notice is sent shall respond to the notification in writing within ten (10) days of its receipt. The arbitration hearing shall be before a panel of three arbitrators, each of whom must be a present or former officer of a life insurance company. An arbitrator may not be a present or former officer, attorney, or consultant of the CEDING COMPANY or the REINSURER or either's affiliates. The CEDING COMPANY and the REINSURER shall each name five (5) candidates to serve as an arbitrator. The CEDING COMPANY and the REINSURER shall each choose one candidate from the other party's list, and these two candidates shall serve as the first two arbitrators. If one or more candidates so chosen shall decline to serve as an arbitrator, the party which named such candidate shall add an additional candidate to its list, and the other party shall again choose one candidate from the list. This process shall continue until two arbitrators have been chosen and have accepted. The CEDING COMPANY and the REINSURER shall each present their initial lists of five (5) candidates by written notification to the other party within twenty-five (25) days of the date of the mailing of the notification initiating the arbitration. Any subsequent additions to the list which are required shall be presented within ten (10) days of the date the naming party receives notice that a candidate that has been chosen declines to serve. The two arbitrators shall then select the third arbitrator from the eight (8) candidates remaining on the lists of the CEDING COMPANY and the REINSURER within fourteen (14) days of the acceptance of their positions as arbitrators. If the two arbitrators cannot agree on the choice of a third, then this choice shall be referred back to the CEDING COMPANY and the REINSURER. The CEDING COMPANY and the REINSURER shall take turns striking the name of one of the remaining candidates from the initial eight (8) candidates until only one candidate remains. If the candidate so chosen shall decline to serve as the third arbitrator, the candidate whose name was stricken last shall be nominated as the third arbitrator. This process shall continue until a candidate has been chosen and has accepted. This candidate shall serve as the third arbitrator. The first turn at striking the name of a candidate shall belong to the party that is responding to the other party's initiation of the arbitration. Once chosen, the arbitrators are empowered to decide all substantive and procedural issues by a majority of votes. It is agreed that each of the three arbitrators should be impartial regard- ing the dispute and should resolve the dispute on the basis described in the "ARBITRATION" section. Therefore, at no time will either the CEDING COMPANY or the REINSURER contact or otherwise communicate with any person who is to be or has been designated as a candidate to serve as an arbitrator concerning the dispute, except upon the basis of jointly drafted communications (which may include independently prepared statements) provided by both the CEDING COMPANY and the REINSURER to inform those candidates actually chosen as arbitrators of the nature and facts of the dispute. Likewise, any written or oral arguments provided to the arbitrators concerning the dispute ITEM 10 - 13 Page 85 SCHEDULE VII (CONTINUED) shall be coordinated with the other party and shall be provided simultaneously to the other party or shall take place in the presence of the other party. Further, at no time shall any arbitrator be informed that the arbitrator has been named or chosen by one party or the other. The arbitration hearing shall be held on the date fixed by the arbitrators. In no event shall this date be later than six (6) months after the appointment of the third arbitrator. The arbitration hearing shall be held in the city where the home office of the party responding to the arbitration is located. As soon as possible, the arbitrators shall establish pre- arbitration procedures as warranted by the facts and issues of the particular case. At least ten (10) days prior to the arbitration hearing, each party shall provide the other party and the arbitrators with a detailed statement of the facts and arguments it will present at the arbitration hearing. The arbitrators may consider any relevant evidence; they shall give the evidence such weight as they deem it entitled to after consideration of any objections raised concerning it. The party initiating the arbitration shall have the burden of proving its case by a preponderance of the evidence. Each party may examine any witnesses who testify at the arbitration hearing. Within twenty (20) days following the end of the arbitration hearing, the arbitrators shall issue a written decision which shall set forth their decision and the factual basis for their decision. In their written decision the arbitrators shall demonstrate that they have off-set mutual debts and credits as provided in this Agreement. In no event, however, may the arbitrators award punitive or exemplary damages. In their decision, the arbitrators shall also apportion the costs of arbitration, which shall include, but not be limited to, their own fees and expenses. ITEM 10 - 13 Page 86 SCHEDULE VIII SECTION 1.848-2(G)(8) ELECTION The CEDING COMPANY and the REINSURER agree to the following pursuant to Section 1.848-2(g)(8) of the Income Tax Regulations issued December 1992 under Section 848 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (hereinafter "Section 1.848- 2(g)(8)"). 1. As used below, the term "party" will refer to the CEDING COMPANY or the REINSURER as appropriate. 2. As used below, the phrases "net positive consideration", "capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses", "general deductions limitation", and "net consideration" shall have the meaning used in Section 1.848-2(g)(8). 3. The party with net positive consideration for this Agreement for any taxable year beginning with the taxable year prescribed in paragraph 5 below will capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to this Agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation. 4. The parties agree to exchange information pertaining to the amount of net consideration under this Agreement to ensure consistency. This will be accomplished as follows: (a) The CEDING COMPANY shall submit to the REINSURER by the fifteenth day of May in each year its calculation of the net consideration for the preceding calendar year. Such calculation will be accompanied by a statement signed by an officer of the CEDING COMPANY stating that the CEDING COMPANY will report such net consideration in its tax return for the preceding calendar year. (b) The REINSURER may contest such calculation by providing an alternative calculation to the CEDING COMPANY in writing within thirty (30) days of the REINSURER'S receipt of the CEDING COMPANY'S calculation. If the REINSURER does not so notify the CEDING COMPANY, the REINSURER will report the net consideration as determined by the CEDING COMPANY in the REINSURER'S tax return for the previous calendar year. (c) If the REINSURER contests the CEDING COMPANY'S calculation of the net consideration, the parties will act in good faith to reach an agreement as to the current amount within thirty (30) days of the date the REINSURER submits its alternative calculation. ITEM 10 - 13 Page 87 SCHEDULE VIII (CONTINUED) If the CEDING COMPANY and the REINSURER reach agreement on an amount of net consideration, each party shall report such amount in their respective tax returns for the preceding calendar year. 5. This election shall be effective for 1995 and all subsequent taxable years for which the Reinsurance Agreement remains in effect. ITEM 10 - 13 Page 88 SCHEDULE IX DEFERRED PROFIT SHARING ACCOUNT The REINSURER shall maintain a Deferred Profit Sharing Account during the term of this Agreement in the amount defined below. The value of the Deferred Profit Sharing Account shall be zero as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Additions to and subtractions from the Deferred Profit Sharing Account shall be made in accordance with Schedule V, Part A; but in no event shall the resulting balance be less than zero nor greater than the maximum amount. The maximum amount shall be determined as (a) plus (b) minus (c) plus (d) where (a) equals the principal amount of the ACCEL Note held by the REINSURER, its affiliates and/or its direct or indirect retrocessionaires, and (b) equals the total of the REINSURER'S Scheduled Charges across all years, and (c) equals the total of the REINSURER'S Scheduled Charges assessed to date, and (d) equals the Loss Carryforward, if any. Should the calculated balance in the Deferred Profit Sharing Account exceed the maximum amount, such excess amount over the maximum amount shall be paid to the CEDING COMPANY in the form of a reduction of premium as provided for in Section B, paragraph 2, of this Agreement. Only amounts in excess of the maximum amount shall be deemed earned.
