Alberto-Culver Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on From 10-K or any incorporated document. PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION Alberto-Culver Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (herein referred to collectively as the "company", unless indicated otherwise) have two principal business segments. One segment, "Consumer Products" principally includes developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing branded consumer products worldwide and includes the company's Alberto-Culver USA and Alberto- Culver International business units. This segment also includes the manufacturing of custom label products for other companies and products intended for end use by institutions and industries. The second segment, "Specialty Distribution - Sally", consists of Sally Beauty Company, a specialty distributor of professional beauty supplies with 1,998 stores as of September 30, 1998 in the United States, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany. Financial information about business segments and geographic area information is incorporated herein by reference to the "Business Segments and Geographic Area Information" note of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in the company's annual report to stockholders for the year ended September 30, 1998. PRODUCTS The classes of products in the "Consumer Products" business segment include health and beauty care products as well as food and household products. Health and beauty care products accounted for approximately 41%, 43% and 43% of the company's consolidated net sales for the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Food and household products accounted for approximately 6%, 7% and 8% of the company's consolidated net sales for the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The company's major health and beauty care products in the United States include the ALBERTO VO5, TRESemme and CONSORT lines of hair care products, the ST. IVES SWISS FORMULA line of hair and skin care products, CORTEXX hair care products, FDS feminine deodorant sprays and the TCB line of hair care products for the ethnic market. Food and household products sold in the United States include MRS. DASH salt-free seasonings, MOLLY McBUTTER dairy sprinkles, SUGARTWIN sugar substitute and STATIC GUARD anti-static spray. The company sold its Milani, Diafoods, Thick- It and Smithers institutional food lines in July, 1996. - 2 -  The company's consumer products are sold in more than 120 countries. Through its Cederroth subsidiary, the company manufactures and markets health and beauty care products throughout Scandinavia and Europe. Major products include SALVE adhesive bandages, ALBERTO VO5 hair care products, SAMARIN antacids, SELTIN salt substitute, LACTACYD liquid soap, TOPZ cotton buds, SAVETTE wet wipes, BLIW liquid soaps, DATE anti-perspirants and cologne for women, FAMILY FRESH shampoo and shower products, SUKETTER artificial sweetener, HEMANENT home permanents, the ST. IVES SWISS FORMULA line of hair and skin care products, HTH and L300 skin care products and GRUMME TVATTSAPA detergents. In the United Kingdom, the company markets, among other products, the ALBERTO VO5 line of hair care products, the ST. IVES SWISS FORMULA line of hair and skin care products, ALBERTO BALSAM shampoo and conditioner and the TRESemme line of hair care products. INDOLA professional hair colors, shampoos, conditioners and styling products are marketed throughout Europe and other international markets. Other international markets include Australia, Canada, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand and Puerto Rico. The "Specialty Distribution - Sally" business segment represents the operations of Sally Beauty Company, Inc. which operates a network of cash-and-carry professional beauty supply stores and also sells professional beauty products to hairdressers, beauticians and cosmetologists through its full-service distributors. Sally stores provide salon owners, hairdressers and consumers with an extensive selection of hair care and skin care products, cosmetics, styling appliances and other beauty items. Sales of the "Specialty Distribution - Sally" business segment accounted for approximately 53%, 50% and 49% of the company's consolidated net sales for the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Many of the company's consumer products are developed in the company's laboratories. New products introduced by the company are assigned product managers who guide the products from development to the consumer. The product managers are responsible for the overall marketing plans for the products and coordinate advertising, promotion and market research activities. MARKETING The company allocates a large portion of its revenues to advertising, promotion and market research. Net earnings are materially affected by these expenditures, which are charged to income in the period incurred. Advertising, promotion and market research expenditures were $257.7 million in 1998, $255.3 million in 1997 and $208.4 million in 1996. Advertising, promotion and market research expenditures relating to a new product will ordinarily constitute a higher percentage of sales than in the case of a well-established product. There can be no assurance that such expenditures will result in consumer acceptance and profitability for a product. The company regards television as the best medium for its advertising and uses it to conduct extensive network, spot and cable television advertising campaigns. The company also advertises through other media such as newspapers, magazines and radio as well as through Sally Beauty Company's direct mailings to professional customers. Extensive advertising and promotion are required to build and protect a product's market position. The company believes there is significant consumer awareness of its major brands and that such awareness is an important factor in the company's operating results. - 3 -  COMPETITION The markets for the company's branded consumer products are highly competitive and sensitive to changes in consumer preferences and demands. The company's competitors range in size from large, highly diversified companies (some of which have substantially greater financial resources than the company) to small, specialized producers. The company competes on the basis of product quality and price and believes that brand loyalty and consumer acceptance are important factors. The company's markets are characterized by frequent introductions of competitive products and by the entry of other manufacturers as new competitors, both of which are typically accompanied by extensive advertising and promotional campaigns. Such campaigns are often very costly and can significantly affect the sales and earnings of the company and its competitors. Sally Beauty Company experiences competition from local and regional professional beauty supply stores, full- service dealers calling directly on salons and a wide range of retail outlets carrying a limited selection of professional beauty products. DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES Retail health and beauty care products and food and household products for Alberto-Culver USA are sold primarily through the company's sales force consisting of approximately 50 employees and 130 independent brokers calling upon wholesale drug establishments and retail outlets such as supermarkets, drug stores, mass merchandisers and variety stores. Hair care products for the professional trade in the United States are sold by company sales representatives and brokers to beauty supply outlets and to beauty distributors who in turn sell to beauty salons, barber shops and beauty schools. Sally Beauty Company sells professional beauty supplies through full-service distributors and its 1,998 stores located in 46 states, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany. Sally's stores are self-service, cash-and-carry and are primarily located in shopping centers. Sally operates the world's largest chain of professional beauty supply stores and as such is a major customer of some of the company's competitors in the personal care products industry. Sally sells Alberto-Culver USA's professional hair care products, but these products represent only a small portion of Sally's selection of salon brands. FOREIGN OPERATIONS Products of the company are sold in more than 120 countries or geographic regions, primarily through direct sales by subsidiaries, independent distributors and licensees. The company's foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in transactions involving foreign currencies and political uncertainties. EMPLOYEES In its domestic and foreign operations, the company had approximately 12,700 full- time equivalent employees as of September 30, 1998, consisting of 7,700 hourly personnel and 5,000 salaried employees. At September 30, 1997, the company had approximately 11,000 full-time equivalent employees. The increase in employees during fiscal year 1998 is principally due to the growth in the number of Sally Beauty Company stores. Certain subsidiaries of the company have union contracts covering production, warehouse, shipping and maintenance personnel. The company considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory. - 4 - REGULATION The company is subject to the regulations of several federal and state agencies, including the Federal Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission. TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS The company's trademarks, certain of which are material to its business, are registered or legally protected in the United States, Canada and other countries throughout the world in which products of the company are sold. Although the company owns patents and has other patent applications pending, its business is not materially dependent upon patents or patent protection. - 5 -  ITEM 2.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include accounts of Alberto-Culver Company and its subsidiaries ("company"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. These investments are stated at cost which approximates market value. Short-term investments are stated at cost which is equal to market value at September 30, 1998 and 1997. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its recorded value. INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market (net realizable value). PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided primarily on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. GOODWILL AND TRADE NAMES The cost of goodwill and trade names is amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from ten to forty years. Management periodically considers whether there has been a permanent impairment to the value of goodwill and trade names by evaluating various factors including current operating results, market and economic conditions and anticipated future results and cash flows. Accumulated amortization at September 30, 1998 and 1997 was $30.6 million and $23.8 million, respectively. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Foreign currency balance sheet accounts are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates during the period. Realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions included in the consolidated statements of earnings resulted in losses of $855,000, $1.2 million and $17,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. ADVERTISING, PROMOTION AND MARKET RESEARCH Advertising, promotion and market research costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $257.7 million, $255.3 million and $208.4 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. INCOME TAXES Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are estimated to be recovered or settled. CALCULATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average shares outstanding of 56,845,000 in 1998, 55,967,000 in 1997 and 55,571,000 in 1996. Diluted earnings per share are determined by dividing net earnings plus interest expense (net of tax benefit) on the convertible subordinated debentures by the weighted average shares outstanding, after giving effect to common shares to be issued assuming conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures to common shares and other common equivalent shares. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 62,420,000 in 1998, 63,377,000 in 1997 and 62,776,000 in 1996.  The following table provides a reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per share: (In thousands) 1998 1997 1996 Net earnings $83,067 85,417 62,744 Interest expense on convertible subordinated debentures, net of tax benefit 2,730 3,640 3,640 ----- ----- ----- Diluted net earnings $85,797 89,057 66,384 ======= ====== ====== Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 56,845 55,967 55,571 Effect of dilutive securities: Assumed conversion of subordinated debentures 4,633 6,178 6,178 Assumed exercise of stock options 917 1,232 1,027 Other 25 -- -- Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 62,420 63,377 62,776 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," requires either the adoption of a fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation or pro-forma disclosures as if the fair value method was adopted. The company has elected to continue measuring compensation expense for its stock-based plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees". Pro- forma disclosures assuming the fair value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123 had been used to measure compensation expense are provided in note 5. (2) Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses consist of the following: (In thousands) 1998 1997 Compensation and benefits $48,854 51,549 Advertising and promotions 26,250 29,312 Other 36,911 37,586 ------ ------ $112,015 118,447 ======== ======= (3) Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements Long-term debt, exclusive of cu  rrent maturities, consists of the following: (In thousands) 1998 1997 6.375% debentures due June, 2028 $120,000 -- 5.5% convertible subordinated debentures due June, 2005 -- 100,000 6.2% term note due September, 2000 20,000 20,000 Revolving Swedish krona credit agreements due April, 2000 at 4.4% to 11.7% 30,163 27,736 Other, principally foreign borrowings and capitalized leases, at weighted average interest rates of 7.4% in 1998 and 7.6% in 1997 1,597 1,705 ----- ----- $171,760 149,441 ======== ======= Maturities of debt for the next five years are as follows (in thousands) 1999 - $959; 2000 - $50,657; 2001 - $442; 2002 - $298; 2003 - $81; 2004 and later $120,282. In June, 1998, the company issued $120 million of 6.375% debentures due June 15, 2028. The debentures are subject to repayment, in whole or in part, on June 15, 2008 at the option of the holders. In addition, the company has the option to redeem the debentures at any time, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and, if applicable, a make-whole premium.  In July, 1998, the 5.5% convertible subordinated debentures were converted into 6.2 million Class A common shares at a conversion rate of 61.776 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $16.19). The company has a $200 million revolving credit facility which expires in September, 2002. The facility, which is unused at September 30, 1998, can be increased to $300 million under certain conditions and may be drawn in U.S. dollars or certain foreign currencies. In January, 1998, the company renewed an agreement to sell, without recourse, up to $30 million of designated trade receivables on an ongoing basis. The agreement expires in one year and is renewable annually upon the mutual consent of both parties. At September 30, 1998, the facility was fully utilized. Costs related to this agreement are included in administrative expenses. The $200 million revolving credit facility, the term note due September, 2000 and the receivables agreement impose restrictions on such items as total debt, working capital, dividend payments, treasury stock purchases and interest expense. At September 30, 1998, the company was in compliance with these arrangements and $220 million of consolidated retained earnings was not restricted as to the payment of dividends. (4) Stockholders' Equity The company has two classes of common stock, both of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Except for voting, dividend and conversion rights, the Class A and Class B common stock are identical. Class A has one- tenth vote per share and Class B has one vote per share. No dividend may be paid on the Class B unless an equal or greater dividend is paid on the Class A, and dividends may be paid on the Class A in excess of dividends paid, or without paying dividends, on the Class B. All, and not less than all, of the Class A may at any time be converted into Class B on a share-for-share basis at the option of the company. The Class B is convertible into Class A on a share-for-share basis at the option of the holders. Cash dividends for Class B common stock in 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $7.6 million or $.23 per share, $6.5 million or $.195 per share and $5.9 million or $.175 per share, respectively. Cash dividends for Class A common stock in 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $5.6 million or $.23 per share, $4.4 million or $.195 per share and $3.9 million or $.175 per share, respectively. Class A common stock dividends per share have been equal to those of Class B common stock since the Class A shares were issued in April, 1986. At the company's annual meeting in January, 1997, stockholders approved an increase in both Class A and Class B authorized shares from 25,000,000 shares to 75,000,000 shares. In January, 1997, the Board of Directors declared a 100% stock dividend on both the Class A and Class B outstanding shares effective February, 1997. The stock dividend was distributed only on outstanding shares and not on shares held in the treasury. An amount equal to the twenty-two cents per share par value of the additional shares was transferred from retained earnings to common stock. All share and per share information in this report, except for treasury shares and the twenty-two cents per share par value, has been restated to reflect the 100% stock dividend. During fiscal 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the company to purchase up to 6.0 million shares of its Class A common stock. As of September 30, 1998, the company had purchased 5,554,600 Class A common shares under this program at a total cost of $126.1 million. In addition, during fiscal 1998 the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 385,000 Class B common shares from a related party at a total cost of $11.2 million, which was equal to fair market value on the date of purchase. (5) Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans Pursuant to its stock option plans, the company is authorized to issue non-qualified options to employees and non-employee directors to purchase a limited number of shares of the company's Class A common stock at a price not less than the fair market value of the stock on date of grant. Options under the plans expire five or ten years from date of grant and are exercisable on a cumulative basis in four equal annual increments commencing one year after the date of grant. A total of 10.6 million shares have been authorized to be issued under the plans. The company accounts for its stock option plans under the intrinsic value method and, accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings. Had compensation expense for these plans been determined based upon the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant and recognized over the four-year vesting period consistent with SFAS No. 123, the company's pro-forma net earnings and earnings per share for the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996 would have been as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): 1998 1997 1996 Net earnings: As reported $83,067 85,417 62,744 Pro-forma $80,090 83,572 61,688 Basic earning per share: As reported $1.46 1.53 1.13 Pro-forma $1.41 1.49 1.11 Diluted earnings per share: As reported $1.37 1.41 1.06 Pro-forma $1.33 1.38 1.04  The weighted average fair value of options at the date of grant in 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $7.37, $5.72 and $3.67 per option, respectively. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 1998 1997 1996 Expected life 5 years 5 year 5 years Volatility 19.5% 18.7% 18.7% Risk-free interest rate 5.5%-5.9% 6.7%-6.8% 6.0%-6.9% Dividend yield 0.8%-1.0% 0.8%-0.9% 1.1%-1.2% Summarized information on the company's outstanding stock options at September 30, 1998 is as follows (options in thousands): Options Options Outstanding Exercisable Average Weighted Weighted Range of Number Remaining Average Number Average Exercise of Contractual Option of Option Prices Options Life Price Options Price $6.63-$9.94 215 3.6 years $ 9.57 215 $ 9.57 $10.73-$13.38 1,243 6.3 years $12.51 645 $12.19 $16.25-$21.72 721 8.1 years $19.69 139 $19.50 $25.09-$26.63 876 9.0 years $26.19 214 $26.19 Stock option activity under the plans is summarized as follows (options in thousands): Number Weighted of Average Options Option Price Outstanding at September 30, 1995 2,230 $11.06 Granted 1,031 13.59 Exercised (167) 10.30 Canceled (105) 12.24 Outstanding at September 30, 1996 2,989 11.93 Granted 888 19.80 Exercised (490) 11.35 Canceled (132) 15.33 Outstanding at September 30, 1997 3,255 14.03 Granted 927 26.19 Exercised (918) 12.32 Canceled (209) 18.61 Outstanding at September 30, 1998 3,055 $17.92 Exercisable at September 30: 1996 1,054 $10.80 1997 1,296 $11.38 1998 1,213 $15.04 The company is also authorized to grant up to 500,000 shares of Class A common stock to employees under its restricted stock plan. The restricted shares vest on a cumulative basis in four equal annual installments commencing four years after the date of grant. During 1998, employees were granted 73,000 restricted shares at a weighted average fair value of $26.18 per share on the date of grant. At September 30, 1998, there were 194,500 restricted shares outstanding.  (6) Income Taxes The provisions for income taxes consist of the following: (In thousands) 1998 1997 1996 Current: Federal $28,176 31,553 27,651 Foreign 6,089 5,716 5,566 State 5,122 6,015 5,911 ----- ----- ----- 39,387 43,284 39,128 ------ ------ ------ Deferred: Federal 6,928 4,849 (2,349) Foreign 2,716 2,549 1,268 State 280 22 (777) --- -- ---- 9,924 7,420 (1,858) ----- ----- ------ $49,311 50,704 37,270 ======= ====== ====== The difference between the effective income tax rate and the United States statutory federal income tax rate is summarized below: 1998 1997 1996 Statutory tax rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Effect of foreign income tax rates (.8) (1.3) (1.5) State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 2.7 2.9 3.3 Other, net .4 .7 .5 -- -- -- Effective tax rate 37.3% 37.3% 37.3% ==== ==== ==== Significant components of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities at September 30, 1998 and 1997 are as follows: (In thousands) 1998 1997 Deferred tax assets attributable to: Accrued expenses $11,713 16,456 Inventory adjustments -- 996 Other 380 2,352 --- ----- Total deferred tax assets 12,093 19,804 ------ ------ Deferred tax liabilities attributable to: Depreciation and amortization 28,021 27,503 Inventory adjustments 1,600 -- State income taxes 619 339 --- --- Total deferred tax liabilities 30,240 27,842 ------ ------ Net deferred tax liabilities ($18,147) (8,038) ======== ====== Prepaid expenses at September 30, 1998 and 1997 include $10.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets. Domestic earnings before income taxes were $105.0 million, $110.9 million (including the non- recurring gain) and $77.9 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Foreign operations had earnings before income taxes of $27.4 million, $25.2 million and $22.1 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Undistributed earnings of the company's foreign operations amounting to $134.9 million are intended to remain permanently invested to finance future growth and expansion. Accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided on those earnings at September 30, 1998. Should such earnings be distributed, the credits for foreign income taxes paid would substantially offset applicable U.S. income taxes.  (7) Lease Commitments The major portion of the company's leases are for Sally Beauty Company stores. Other leases cover certain manufacturing and warehousing properties, office facilities, data processing equipment and automobiles. At September 30, 1998, future minimum payments under noncancelable leases are as follows: Operating Capital (In thousands) Leases Leases 1999 $46,813 402 2000 38,773 235 2001 30,044 131 2002 21,295 62 2003 11,597 8 2004 and later 7,863 -- - ---- ----- Total minimum lease payments $156,385 838 ======== === Total rental expense for operating leases amounted to $63.1 million in 1998, $59.6 million in 1997 and $53.0 million in 1996. Certain leases require the company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and special assessments. (8) Non-Recurring Gain In the first quarter of 1997, the company received a $28.0 million insurance settlement from the loss of its corporate airplane. The effect on the company's earnings was a non-recurring pre-tax gain of $15.6 million and an increase in net earnings of $9.8 million. Accordingly, basic earnings per share increased $.18 and diluted earnings per share increased $.16. The following table provides pro-forma information excluding the non-recurring gain (in thousands, except per share data): 1998 1997 Pre-tax earnings $132,378 120,487 Net earnings $83,067 75,606 Net earnings per share: Basic $1.46 1.35 Diluted $1.37 1.25 (9) Business Segments and Geographic Area Information The "consumer products" business segment principally includes developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing branded consumer products worldwide and includes the company's Alberto-Culver USA and Alberto-Culver International business units. This segment also includes products intended for end use by institutions and industries and the manufacturing of custom label products for other companies. The "specialty distribution - Sally" business segment consists of Sally Beauty Company, a specialty distributor of  professional beauty supplies.  Notes Continued  Notes Continued (10) Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of earnings information for the years ended September 30, 1998 and 1997 is summarized below (in thousands, except per share amounts): 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter 1998: Net sales $445,400 455,195 467,480 466,636 Cost of products sold $218,040 225,770 227,104 231,181 Net earnings $19,692 19,583 21,155 22,637 Earnings per share: Basic $.35 .34 .38 .39 Diluted $.32 .32 .35 .38 1997 As Reported: Net sales $426,105 439,577 456,210 453,366 Cost of products sold $215,388 218,057 226,734 220,237 Net earnings $ 26,588 17,781 19,210 21,838 Earnings per share: Basic $.48 .32 .34 .39 Diluted $.44 .29 .32 . 36 1997 Pro Forma: Net earnings before non-recurring gain $16,777  17,781 19,210 21,838 Earnings per share before non-recurring gain: Basic $.30  .32 .34 .39 Diluted $.28  .29 .32 . 36   Excludes a non-recurring gain of $9.8 million or $.18 basic earnings per share and $.16 diluted earnings per share (note 8). (11) Acquisitions and Divestiture In February, 1996, the company acquired St. Ives Laboratories, Inc. ("St. Ives") for approximately $110 million. St. Ives develops, manufactures and markets personal care products under its St. Ives Swiss Formula brand and manufactures custom label products for other companies. The purchase of St. Ives was funded with the net proceeds available from the July, 1995 issuance of $100 million of 5.5% convertible subordinated debentures and from the sale of certain trade accounts receivable in January, 1996. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the operating results of St. Ives have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired of approximately $51 million is being amortized over 40 years. The company also made several other acquisitions during fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996, primarily related to Sally Beauty Company's operations, that were insignificant to the consolidated financial statements. In July, 1996, Alberto-Culver USA sold its Milani, DiaFoods, Thick-It and Smithers institutional food lines and granted the purchaser a master distribution license to sell the company's other institutional food products. The transaction resulted in an immaterial gain.  Independent Auditors' Report The Board of Directors and Stockholders Alberto-Culver Company: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alberto-Culver Company and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 1998. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alberto-Culver Company and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Chicago, Illinois October 22, 1998 KPMG Peat Marwick LLP Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Alberto-Culver Company and Subsidiaries RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal year 1998 marked the company's seventh consecutive year of record sales and record operating earnings. Net sales for the year ended September 30, 1998 were $1.83 billion, an increase of 3.3% over prior year sales of $1.78 billion. Net sales in 1996 were $1.59 billion. Record net earnings of $83.1 million in 1998 increased 9.9% from 1997 net earnings of $75.6 million before a non-recurring gain. Excluding the 1997 non-recurring gain, basic earnings per share of $1.46 were 11 cents or 8.1% higher than 1997 and diluted earnings per share were $1.37, an increase of 12 cents or 9.6% from 1997. Net earnings in 1996 were $62.7 million, representing basic earnings per share of $1.13 and diluted earnings per share of $1.06. As described in "note 8" to the consolidated financial statements, during fiscal 1997 the company received a $28.0 million insurance settlement from the loss of its corporate airplane. As a result, the company recognized a non-recurring pre-tax gain of $15.6 million and an increase in net earnings of $9.8 million. Accordingly, basic earnings per share in 1997 increased 18 cents and diluted earnings per share increased 16 cents as a result of the non-recurring gain. Fiscal 1998 net earnings decreased $2.4 million or 2.8% compared to fiscal 1997 net earnings including the non-recurring gain. Sales of Alberto-Culver USA consumer products in 1998 were $418.2 million, a decrease of 5.9% from prior year sales of $444.2 million. The 1998 decrease primarily resulted from lower sales for custom label filling operations, St. Ives Swiss Formula facial products and Alberto VO5 shampoo and conditioner. In 1997, sales increased 17.7% over 1996 sales of $377.5 million primarily due to higher sales of St. Ives products in addition to sales increases for TRESemme, TCB, Mrs. Dash, Alberto VO5 Hot Oil and the introduction of new products. Alberto-Culver International consumer products sales were $460.5 million in 1998 compared to $466.5 million in 1997 and $452.0 million in 1996. The fiscal 1998 results were negatively impacted by the effect of foreign exchange rates. Had foreign exchange rates this year been the same as fiscal 1997, Alberto-Culver Internation  al sales would have increased 4.3%. The sales increase in 1997 primarily resulted from higher sales of St. Ives products. Sales of the "Specialty distribution - Sally" business segment increased to $972.8 million in 1998 compared to $879.2 million and $771.9 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The sales increases of 10.6% in 1998 and 13.9% in 1997 were attributable to sales gains for established Sally Beauty Company outlets, the addition of stores during the year and the expansion of Sally's full service and foreign operations through acquisitions and internal growth. The number of Sally stores increased 33.7% during the last three fiscal years to a total of 1,998 at the end of fiscal 1998 compared to 1,833 and 1,656 at the end of 1997 and 1996, respectively. Cost of products sold as a percentage of sales was 49.2% in fiscal year 1998 compared to 49.6% in 1997 and 50.6% in 1996. The lower cost of products sold percentages in 1998 and 1997 were primarily due to cost savings and changes in product mix favoring higher margin products, offset in part by Sally Beauty Company's relatively higher cost of goods sold percentage. Advertising, promotion, selling and administrative expenses increased 3.3% in 1998 and 13.8% in 1997. The increase in 1998 primarily resulted from the higher selling and administration costs associated with the growth of the Sally Beauty business. The higher 1997 expenses were also attributable to Sally's growth as well as the acquisition of St. Ives and higher advertising, promotion and market research expenses for Alberto-Culver USA. Advertising, promotion and market research expenditures were $257.7 million, $255.3 million and $208.4 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The higher expenses in 1998 were mainly attributable to increased advertising and promotion expenditures for Alberto-Culver International. The increase in 1997 expenses mainly resulted from the acquisition of St. Ives and increased marketing expenditures for Alberto- Culver USA, including the introduction of new products. Interest expense, net of interest income, was $8.6 million, $8.2 million and $12.1 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Interest expense was $12.2 million in 1998 versus $11.8 million in 1997 and $15.9 million in 1996. The decrease in interest expense in 1997 was attributable to the prepayment of $20 million of 9.73% term notes in August, 1996 and a reduction in outstanding revolving Swedish krona debt, including the impact of foreign exchange rates. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes was 37.3% in 1998, 1997 and 1996. Factors which influenced the effective tax rates for those years are described in "note 6" to the consolidated financial statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION Working capital at September 30, 1998 was $277.9 million, an increase of $8.9 million from the prior year's working capital of $269.0 million. The resulting current ratio was 1.89 to 1.00 at September 30, 1998 compared to 1.86 to 1.00 last year. Accounts receivable increased 6.9% to $129.1 million from $120.8 million last year. The increase was principally due to the growth of Sally's full service operations. Inventories were $369.2 million at September 30, 1998, up 7.3% compared to $343.9 million last year. The increase was primarily due to higher inventories needed to support the growth of the Sally Beauty business. Net property, plant and equipment increased $32.4 million to $223.5 million at September 30, 1998. The increase resulted primarily from additional Sally stores, warehouse and office expenditures, outlays for machinery, equipment and information systems and the purchase of a replacement corporate airplane, partially offset by depreciation during fiscal 1998. Goodwill and trade names, net of amortization, was $204.8 million as of September 30, 1998, up $20.4 million from 1997. The increase in goodwill and trade names was due to additional goodwill from acquisitions by Sally Beauty Company and Alberto-Culver International partially offset by amortization and the effects of foreign exchange rates. Long-term debt increased $22.3 million principally due to the issuance of $120 million of 6.375% debentures in June, 1998, substantially offset by the conversion of the $100 of million subordinated debentures into Class A common shares in July, 1998. Total stockholders' equity increased $37.0 million to $534.0 million at September 30, 1998. The increase was primarily due to net earnings for the fiscal year and the conversion of the subordinated debentures into Class A common shares, substantially offset by the repurchase of 5.9 million Class A common shares and 385,000 Class B common shares and dividend payments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The company's primary sources of cash over the past three years have been from funds provided by operating activities, the issuance of $120 million of 6.375% debentures in June, 1998 and the 1996 sale of $30 million of trade accounts receivable. Operating activities provided cash of $110.4 million, $79.7 million and $92.7 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The company has obtained long-term financing as needed to fund acquisitions and other growth opportunities. Funds are occasionally obtained prior to their actual need in order to take advantage of opportunities in the debt markets. In June, 1998, the company issued $120 million of 6.375% debentures due June, 2028. As a result, the company has $230 million remaining on its $350 million shelf registration of debt securities that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April, 1998. In September, 1997, the company obtained a five-year, $200 million revolving credit facility. The facility, which is unused at September 30, 1998, can be increased to $300 million under certain conditions and may be drawn in U.S. dollars or in certain foreign currencies. Under debt covenants, the company has the ability to incur up to $646 million of additional debt. The primary uses of cash during the three-year period ending September 30, 1998 have been acquisitions of $180.5 million, purchases of treasury stock of $147.4 million, capital expenditures of $155.0 million and cash dividends of $33.9 million. Compared to 1995, cash dividends per share increased 48.4% over the three-year period ended September 30, 1998. Cash dividends paid on Class A and Class B common stock were $.230 per share in 1998, $.195 per share in 1997 and $.175 per share in 1996. The company anticipates that cash flows from operations and available credit will be sufficient to fund operational requirements in future years. During 1999, the company expects that cash will continue to be used for acquisitions, capital expenditures, new product development, market expansion, retirement of debt and dividend payments. The company may also purchase shares of its common stock depending on market conditions. During fiscal 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the company to purchase up to 6.0 million shares of its Class A common stock. As of September 30, 1998, 445,400 shares remained available for purchase under this authorization. In October, 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 3.0 million Class A shares. YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURES Many computer systems use only two digits to represent the year and they may be unable to process accurately information that contains dates before, during or after the year 2000. As a result, organizations that depend on computers are at risk for possible date- based computation errors which could result in erroneous information or system failures that may disrupt their business operations. This is commonly known as the Year 2000 ("Y2K") problem. Most of the software purchased by the company within the last five years is either Y2K compliant or the vendor has certified that Y2K compliant upgrades will be available sufficiently in advance of December 31, 1999. In late 1995, the company inventoried and assessed key financial and operational information systems and prepared a prioritized plan for Y2K systems modifications or replacements. The plan is revised periodically and progress against the plan is monitored and periodically reported to management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Implementation of required changes to the company's critical systems is currently scheduled to be completed by August, 1999. Certification of critical systems, which includes testing by technicians and key users, is expected to be completed before December 31, 1999. The company's assessment of non- information technology systems (e.g., manufacturing equipment) is expected to be completed by February, 1999, and an action plan will be prepared based on the results.  As part of the Y2K readiness plan, the company's most important suppliers and customers have been queried (e.g., by questionnaires) about their Y2K readiness. Additional steps will be taken to reassess their Y2K readiness through additional questionnaires, interviews, on-site visits and other means. The company expects to have a better understanding of the Y2K readiness of these third parties over the next several months. Because of the number of computer systems used by the company, the number of key suppliers and customers and the company's operations around the world, the company presently believes that it could experience some disruption in its business due to the Y2K problem. The company could be materially affected if utilities, governmental entities, suppliers, customers or other third parties with which it does business or that provide essential services are not Y2K compliant. The company currently believes that the greatest risk of disruption in its businesses may exist outside the United States with suppliers or other third- parties that are not Y2K compliant. In addition, both the assessment and mitigation of Y2K exposure outside the US may be complicated by any unrelated foreign entities' unwillingness to provide information about their state of Y2K readiness. The possible consequences of the company, key suppliers or customers not being Y2K complaint by January 1, 2000 include, among other things, temporary plant closings, delays in the delivery of products, delays in the receipt of supplies, and invoice and collection errors. Consequently, the business and results of operations of the company could be materially affected by the inability of the company to conduct its businesses in an ordinary course for a period of time after January 1, 2000. However, the company believes that its Y2K readiness plan, including the contingency planning discussed below, should significantly reduce the adverse effect any such disruptions may have. The company is developing a contingency plan to be followed in the event of a Y2K-related failure of a business-critical system. This plan should be complete by June, 1999 and is expected to include, for example, identification of alternate suppliers and possible increases in inventory levels, including raw materials and packaging. Once developed, contingency plans and related cost estimates will be refined as additional information becomes available. Incremental costs, which include contractor costs to modify existing systems and costs of internal resources dedicated to achieving Y2K compliance, are charged to expense as incurred. These costs are currently expected to total approximately $2.3 million, of which approximately 40% has been spent to date. Incremental costs are presently being funded through operating cash flow. The amounts do not include any costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans, which are in the process of being developed, as discussed above. The costs associated with replacement of computerized systems, hardware and related equipment (currently estimated to be approximately $6.2 million), substantially all of which will be capitalized, are not included in the above estimates. The company's Y2K readiness program is an evolving and ongoing process. Accordingly, our current conclusions as to what constitutes areas of the company's greatest Y2K exposure and the estimates of costs and completion dates, as described above, are subject to change. The Y2K problem has many aspects and potential consequences, some of which are not reasonably foreseeable, and there can be no assurance that unforeseen consequences will not arise. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June, 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," which requires the prominent display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. The company is required to comply with SFAS No. 130 in fiscal year 1999 and currently believes its adoption will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In June, 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in financial statements. The company is required to comply with SFAS No. 131 in fiscal year 1999 and does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In March, 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98-1 revises the accounting treatment of software development costs and requires capitalization of certain costs which the company has historically expensed as incurred. The company is required to comply with SOP 98-1 in fiscal year 2000 and currently believes its adoption will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. INFLATION The company was not significantly affected by inflation during the past three years. Management continuously attempts to resist cost increases and counteract the effects of inflation through productivity improvements, cost reduction programs and price increases within the constraints of the highly competitive markets in which the company operates. MARKET RISK As a multinational corporation that manufactures and markets products in countries throughout the world, the company is subject to certain market risks, including foreign currency, interest rates and government actions. The company uses a variety of practices to manage these market risks, including, when considered appropriate, derivative financial instruments. The company uses derivative financial instruments only for risk management and does not use them for trading or speculative purposes. The company is exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. The company's primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the U.S. dollar versus the Swedish krona, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the Mexican peso.  The company's various currency exposures often offset each other, providing a natural hedge against currency risk. Periodically, specific foreign currency transactions (e.g. inventory purchases, royalty payments, etc.) are hedged with forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency risk. Gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges are included in the basis of the underlying hedged transactions. As of September 30, 1998, the company had an outstanding foreign currency contract to sell the equivalent of $1.3 million of Japanese yen to hedge a third-party royalty agreement. The fair value of this agreement results in an immaterial unrecognized gain at September 30, 1998. Interest rate risk is managed through a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt with varying maturities. At September 30, 1998, variable rate long-term debt was $11.0 million or 6.4% of total long-term debt. The company periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on debt securities. These instruments allow the company to exchange variable rate debt into fixed rate or fixed rate debt into variable rate. Interest rate differentials paid or received on these arrangements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense over the life of the agreement. At September 30, 1998, the company had one interest rate swap outstanding, which expires in November 1998, in a notional amount of $5.0 million. The fair value of this agreement results in an immaterial unrecognized loss at September 30, 1998. The company is exposed to credit risk on certain assets, primarily cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivab  le. The credit risk associated with cash equivalents and short-term investments is mitigated by the company's policy of investing in securities with high credit ratings and investing through major financial institutions with high credit ratings. The company provides credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company's customer base. The company currently believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks.  (1) 1997 excludes a non-recurring gain from an insurance settlement for the loss of the company's corporate airplane (note 8). Pre-tax earnings including the non-recurring gain were $136.1 million. Net earnings including the gain were $85.4 million, after deducting income taxes of $50.7 million, resulting in basic per share of $1.53 and diluted earnings per share of $1.41. (2) Net earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated to reflect the 100% stock dividend on the company's Class A and Class B outstanding shares in February, 1997. (3) Dividends per share on Class A common stock and Class B common stock have been equal since the Class A shares were issued in April, 1986.
