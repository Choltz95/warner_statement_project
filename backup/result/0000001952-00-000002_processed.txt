[X] As of March 15, 2000, 430,302 common shares were outstanding and the aggregate market value of the voting stock (based upon the bid price on March 15, 2000) held by nonaffiliates was approximately $5,993,401. Documents Incorporated by Reference: NONE PART I Item 1. Business Irex Corporation (The Company) consists of five wholly owned subsidiaries which operate within the specialty contracting industry. These companies primarily engage in mechanical insulation, abatement, fire protection and interior finish contracting. Domestic operations are conducted through five wholly owned subsidiaries: ACandS, Inc.; Centin, LLC; Spacecon, LLC; Island Insulation Services, Inc.; and Pyro-Stop, LLC (formed 1/1/2000). Through ACandS Contracting Ltd., the Company is engaged in thermal insulation contracting in Canada. Prior to 1999, the Company also conducted business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Specialty Products & Insulation Co. (SPI), a distributor and fabricator of mechanical insulation, architectural/acoustical products and specialty products. On December 31, 1998, the spin-off of SPI to the Irex shareholders was effective. (See Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) Substantially all of the Company's insulation contracts are made with private contractors, subcontractors and other builders, and such contracts are normally awarded on the basis of competitive bids. Insulation contracting, as part of the general construction business, has been and continues to be highly competitive. The Company is one of the largest in its field, however, and over the years has maintained good customer relationships, with a significant percentage of its sales attributable to contracts with customers for whom the Company has previously done work. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had contract backlog, expressed in terms of unearned revenues for all secured contracts, of $29.5 million as compared to contract backlog of $37.4 million on December 31, 1998. A substantial portion of this backlog can reasonably be expected to be installed during 2000, since the average life cycle of the Company's projects is less than a year. During the past five years, beginning backlog ranged from 27% to 38% of contract revenues reported for the ensuing year. The Company purchases its materials from a number of sources and is not dependent upon any one supplier for any substantial portion of its requirements. Insulation materials are in plentiful supply and no critical shortages are expected. The Company owns or holds no significant patents, licenses, franchises or other concessions. No significant expenditures are made for new product development, since most materials are purchased directly from manufacturers for installation by the Company on projects where the owner or his representatives specify the products to be applied. Federal, state and local regulations enacted to protect the environment have not had any material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Item 2. Properties The Company owns three properties in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. One is used as the Company's general offices, a two-story brick building containing 21,000 square feet of space. A second is primarily used for general office parking. The third consists mainly of a 29,000 square foot warehouse and shop facility which is leased by the Company's former distribution subsidiary. All of the remaining offices and warehouses of the Company are leased at various locations throughout the United States and Canada. Some regional and area offices share facilities at the same location. After the spin- off of SPI, there are 37 leased regional, area and branch offices in the United States and three offices in Canada. The Company also owns construction tools, light trucks, and such related equipment as required by its undertakings, all of which are considered to be in good working order and none of which is subject to any major encumbrances. Most of the automotive fleet has been converted to an operating lease arrangement with cancelable lease terms of up to five years. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company's ACandS, Inc. subsidiary is one of a number of defendants in pending lawsuits filed by approximately 140,000 individual claimants seeking damages for injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos fibers in insulation products used at one time by ACandS in its business. ACandS has defenses to these actions, including defenses based on the fact it is primarily a contracting company in the business of installing products manufactured by others. During 1999, ACandS was served with cases involving 38,446 individual plaintiffs. In 1998, ACandS was served with cases involving 33,154 individual plaintiffs. There were 31,489 new plaintiffs in 1997, 37,777 new plaintiffs in 1996; and 44,904 new plaintiffs in 1995. The filing of numerous asbestos- related bodily injury claims against ACandS began in approximately 1978/1979, but new filings in any single year did not exceed 16,000 until 1993, and did not exceed 21,000 until 1995. The bulk of the litigation against ACandS is centered in a relatively small number of jurisdictions. In 1999, over 75 percent of new claims filed against ACandS came from Texas, Mississippi, Ohio, New York and Maryland. The pattern in 1998 was similar, with the same five states plus West Virginia accounting for over 80 percent of the filings. These jurisdictions have consistently produced heavy filings in recent years. It would appear that court rules and rulings favorable to claimants in these states encourage the filing of asbestos-related lawsuits. The great majority of the filings are apparently the result of screenings and other mass solicitation efforts. The lawsuits which result from such efforts are often filed with little investigation as to whether the claimants had any causative exposure to asbestos-containing products associated with any particular defendant. As the scope of the screening programs has increased, the degree of illness of the claimants seems to have diminished. However, the number of claims by individuals diagnosed with mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung often associated with asbestos exposure, has remained relatively constant. Since the beginning of 1981, approximately 194,000 individual claims against ACandS have been settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. ACandS's average cost for resolving those claims has been low. Over half of the claims were closed without any liability payment by ACandS. In recent years, the courts in many states have given priority to the resolution of more serious cases, such as claims by individuals diagnosed with mesothelioma. This has resulted in some large settlements of individual claims in states such as New York and Maryland. In addition, the litigation risk in jurisdictions which are difficult for defendants has lead ACandS to block settle large numbers of claims in Texas, West Virginia and other states. ACandS's average disposition cost per claim increased significantly in 1998, and increased again in 1999, largely as a result of sums paid in settlement of the more serious cases. The absence of bankrupt manufacturers as defendants has apparently contributed to the increase in ACandS's disposition costs. Asbestos-related bodily injury cases filed against ACandS in federal court have been transferred since July, 1991 to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pretrial handling. Efforts toward a national solution of the asbestos litigation problem have been undertaken in this multidistrict proceeding, but none has been successful. Currently, certain asbestos defendants are supporting national legislation which would establish a comprehensive administrative program to handle asbestos-related claims. ACandS has been informed that the prospects for such legislation are uncertain at best. The defense of the cases pending against ACandS is now being handled by the Travelers Property Casualty Corp. with the participation of other insurers that wrote coverage for ACandS. Virtually all of ACandS's liability and defense costs for these cases are being paid by ACandS's insurance carriers. ACandS through final settlement agreements has secured the commitment of a substantial amount of the considerable insurance coverage it has for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. ACandS believes it will secure additional coverage, if needed, from those insurers which have not to date settled with ACandS. One of the insurers with a continuing obligation to contribute coverage for ACandS has encountered financial difficulties in recent years, in part because of asbestos and environmental liabilities, but ACandS does not believe these difficulties will affect the adequacy of the coverage available to it. It has been more than 25 years since ACandS adopted the policy that it would not resell, use or install asbestos-containing insulation products. Given the length of time since this policy was established, the increased numbers of new claims in the last five years and the increase in disposition cost averages in 1998 and 1999 are troubling developments. The combination of increased filings and higher disposition costs has resulted in escalating annual settlement expenditures by ACandS's insurers. As a result, the rate of exhaustion of ACandS's insurance coverage has increased. The complexity of the asbestos-related disease litigation makes prediction of future events difficult. Nevertheless, ACandS continues to effectively defend asbestos-related bodily injury cases, and anticipates that its average disposition costs will remain low in the context of the litigation. Despite the closing of 194,000 claims, the bulk of ACandS's insurance coverage remains available. Management, therefore, believes that ACandS's insurance coverage is adequate to ensure that these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the long-term business or financial position of the Company. ACandS is one of a number of defendants in three actions by the owners of buildings to recover costs associated with the replacement or treatment of installed asbestos-containing products, one of which is an alleged class action. One hundred three such cases against ACandS have been dismissed and 17 have been settled. No new building-related cases have been served on ACandS since 1994. ACandS believes that its exposure in the three remaining cases is limited. Insurance for the asbestos in building cases is being provided by Travelers Property Casualty Corp. Although that part of the coverage for these cases obtained from policies written by Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. (now part of Travelers) has been provided under a reservation of rights as to the availability and amount of the coverage, necessary insurance payments have been and continue to be made. Based on the rulings to date of courts which have considered the availability of insurance coverage for asbestos in building claims, ACandS does not anticipate significant problems concerning insurance for settled or pending claims. Accordingly, ACandS believes that the asbestos in building claims will not have a material adverse effect on the long-term business or financial condition of the Company. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are also parties as both plaintiff and defendant to various claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, including claims concerning work performed under various contracts. In the opinion of management, claims and litigation resulting in the normal course of business will not materially affect the Company's long- term business, financial position or results of operations. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters The Company's Common Stock is traded in limited over-the-counter transactions. The number of shares of Common Stock available for trading has been small relative to the total number of shares outstanding, and the trading is sporadic. Price quotations are only binding for a limited number of shares. The following table sets forth the high and low bid prices per share and the dividends per share for the periods indicated. Price quotations have been obtained from National Quotation Bureau, Inc. High Bid Low Bid 1998 1st Quarter 31 - 3/8 27 - 1/2 2nd Quarter 37 - 1/2 33 3rd Quarter 37 - 1/2 37 - 1/2 4th Quarter 46 37 - 1/2 1999 1st Quarter 50 16 2nd Quarter 22 16 - 1/4 3rd Quarter 22 - 3/4 20 - 1/2 4th Quarter 21 - 1/4 21 On March 15, 2000, the stock price quotation according to National Quotation Bureau, Inc. was 20.50 bid and none offered, and there were 303 record holders of the Company's Common Stock. The total number of shares outstanding is 430,302. On December 31, 1998 the spin-off of Specialty Products & Insulation Co., the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, was effective. (See Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements statements.) The Company has not paid a cash dividend on its Common Stock during the two-year period ended December 31, 1999. In the foreseeable future, the Company does not expect to pay cash dividends on the outstanding common shares at December 31, 1999. Item 6. Selected Financial Data IREX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES: Following is a consolidated summary of operations for the five years ended December 31, 1999.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations As a result of the spin-off of Specialty Products & Insulation Co. (SPI) on December 31, 1998 (see Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements), the Company's consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 1999 do not include SPI; however, SPI's operating results are included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997. The following discussion, except where noted, compares the Company's performance for the year ended December 31, 1999 with the pro forma unaudited results of operations for the respective periods in 1998 and 1997 as presented in Note 2. The  pro forma unaudited amounts represent the Company's results of operations after giving effect to the dividend received from SPI and SPI's repayment of intercompany debt immediately after the spin-off and the elimination of operating results attributable to SPI for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998 and 1997. The Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 do not include the balance sheet of SPI. Subsequent to the spin- off of its distribution subsidiary, the Company and its subsidiaries continue to operate within the specialty contracting industry. The Company reported net income of $2,621,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $1,099,000 net income for the year ended December 31, 1998. Included in results for 1999 is $1,100,000 income related to the reversal of a contingency accrual (further discussed in Note 5), which contributed approximately $650,000 to net income. Also included in 1999 results is interest income (net of expense) of $1,062,000, which increased net income by approximately $700,000. For the year ended December 31, 1998, net income of $1,099,000 includes an after-tax gain of approximately $490,000 related to curtailment of the Company's pension plan (see Note 9). After adjusting for these non comparable items, net income of $1,271,000 in 1999 was slightly more than double the $609,000 earned in 1998. The Company showed a net loss of $(1,121,000) for the year ended December 31, 1997. Net income applicable to common shareholders after preferred dividends and the premium paid for redemption of preferred stock (see Note 14) was $1,664,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $120,000 in 1998 and a loss of $(2,101,000) in 1997. The Company achieved net income per common share of $3.85 for the year ended December 31, 1999. For the year ended December 31, 1998, net income per common share was $0.29 before the extraordinary loss and the effect of the extraordinary loss was $(0.79) per share. Net loss per common share was $(5.47) for the year ended December 31, 1997. Return on average common shareholders' equity (ROE), calculated on net income applicable to common stock, was 10.3%, for the year ended December 31, 1999. Including the results of SPI, ROE was 21.4% and 12.8% for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Company's return on average assets (ROA), calculated on net income, was 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 1999. Including the results of SPI, ROA was 4.2% and 2.9% for years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Exclusive of the extraordinary loss in 1998, ROE and ROA were 23.6% and 4.5%, respectively. The Company, in its first full year of operations since the spin-off of SPI, has embarked on a strategy that focuses primarily on improving gross profit and operating margins. Securing contracts at margins which reflect the quality of services provided to customers and then aggressively managing a project's execution, with especially safe work practices, will generate improved gross profit margins. The Company's efforts in continually examining and evaluating administrative processes will contribute to improved operating margins. The Company has placed secondary emphasis on revenue growth through both diversification of the specialty contracting services provided to customers and selective acquisition opportunities in markets it presently serves. The following discussion and analysis of results of operations provides additional information on the Company's businesses and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Results of Operations: Total revenues for 1999 increased 3.1% to $136.3 million from $132.2 million in 1998. Total revenues were $129.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Prior to 1999, the Company had experienced a recent trend of declining revenues generated from its traditional core business of installing insulation in industrial and commercial applications. The stabilization of the trend in 1999 is mostly attributable to approximately $12.6 million of work performed at one power generating facility. Although deregulation in the power generation industry has contributed to the erosion of some core business, the Company has been successful in generating additional revenues from nontraditional sources. The Company continues to pursue opportunities outside the core insulation business by providing specialty contracting services for asbestos abatement, lead abatement, interior finish contracting and fire protection. In markets where a significant backlog of work does not exist, a lack of contracts available to bid and competitive pricing in bid opportunities, may lead to fluctuations in revenue performance. The Company does not follow a single-focus strategy to be the low-cost provider of specialty contracting services in each of the markets it serves. Thus, the Company recognizes that it may not secure work in localized markets where the competition is bidding contracts at prices that will not afford the Company an opportunity to earn acceptable gross profit margins. Gross profit increased slightly to $27.8 million in 1999 from $27.2 million in 1998. The 1999 result represents a 5.7% increase from the $26.3 million gross profit achieved in 1997. Margins, or gross profit dollars expressed as a percentage of revenues, were 20.4%, 20.6% and 20.3% in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Competitive bidding to secure lump-sum contracts continues to squeeze pricing while placing a premium on contract execution. The Company has been able to maintain margin levels by focusing on quality of bid preparation, consistent pre- execution planning and aggressive management of direct job costs. In addition, efforts placed on corporate and regional safety initiatives have played a significant role in lowering the number of workers' compensation/insurance claims and ultimately reducing these costs. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $23.5 million in 1999, a decrease of 4.1% from $24.5 million SG&A expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998. Excluding the pension curtailment gain of $869,000 recorded during 1998 (see Note 9), SG&A expenses in 1999 were down 7.4% compared to 1998. SG&A expenses amounted to $28.0 million in 1997. The decrease in 1999 is primarily attributable to the reversal of the $1.1 million contingency accrual noted earlier in the discussion. The restructuring undertaken during 1996 by the Company's principal contracting subsidiary, ACandS, Inc. contributed significantly to the reduction in SG&A from the level reflected in 1997, as did subsequent downsizing by another of the Company's contracting subsidiaries. Management believes that the end product of these actions is the development of an overhead structure which enables the Company to offer competitively-priced services while maintaining responsiveness to customer needs. The Company strives for continual improvement in its processes (e.g. contract sales and execution, office administration) with an aim toward reducing the ratio of SG&A expenses to gross profit earned. Operating income improved to $4.3 million in 1999 from $2.7 million in 1998. Excluding the 1999 contingency reversal and the 1998 curtailment gain noted above, operating income increased approximately 77% to $3.2 million in 1999 from $1.8 million in 1998. The Company incurred a $(1.7) million operating loss in 1997. Operating income, excluding the items noted and expressed as a percentage of revenues, was 2.4%, 1.4% and (1.3)% for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. This trend of improved operating margins reflects the Company's targeted efforts highlighted in the previous discussion. Finance and Liquidity: The Company's working capital position remains strong after the first full year of operations since the spin-off of SPI, whose balance sheet is not included in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1999 and 1998. With the spin- off, the Company will no longer have significant working capital requirements to fund the expansion of SPI. Working capital was $24.1 million at December 31, 1999 as compared to $27.0 million at December 31, 1998. Contract backlog, expressed in terms of unearned revenues for all secured contracts, was $29.5 million at December 31, 1999. This level continues a trend of the past few years where secured contract orders turn over more quickly. Generally, backlog for the specialty contracting industry is lower than that of the overall construction industry when measured in terms of the percentage of annual revenues it represents. The Company's relative mix of both the type of work (insulation, abatement, interior contracting, etc.) and the end customer (industrial, commercial, etc.) contribute to the level of contract backlog at a given point in time. Contract backlog was $37.4 million and $42.8 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, Capital expenditures of $0.4 million in 1999 were comparable to 1998 and 1997 expenditures (exclusive of SPI's operations) of $0.2 million $0.4 million, respectively. Management does not foresee any significant capital expenditures in the near term other than the normal replacement of equipment. The Company has no debt outstanding at December 31, 1999 compared to $0.6 million outstanding at December 31, 1998. The Company was required to repay long-term debt as a result of the spin-off, and it used proceeds from SPI's repayment of intercompany debt to pay down existing lines of credit. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had unsecured credit facilities with several banks totaling $22.5 million. There was availability under these unsecured credit facilities for additional borrowings of $16.0 million and $14.0 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Short-term debt was used to provide funding of $3.2 million for the acquisitions made during 1997. See Note 4 for additional discussion of the Company's acquisitions. The Company expects that funds from operations and available lines of credit will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. See Note 12 for more information on the Company's borrowings. Preferred Stock Issuance and Dividends: During 1992, the Company exchanged 349,864 shares of redeemable preferred stock for an equal number of the Company's outstanding common shares. The common shares exchanged were included in Treasury Stock at December 31, 1999. The Company redeemed 104,970 shares during 1999, of which 104,953 were redeemed as a result of a call authorized by the Board of Directors on April 29, 1999. As a result of the call and subsequent redemption, 244,703 preferred shares remain outstanding at December 31, 1999. See Note 14 for more information on the Company's redeemable preferred stock. Dividends on the preferred stock accrue at an annual rate of $2.80 per share. In the foreseeable future, the Company does not expect to pay cash dividends on the outstanding common shares at December 31, 1999. Income Taxes: The effective tax rate was 51.5% in 1999 compared to 46.8% in 1998 and 43.7 % in 1997. The Company's effective tax rate is primarily dependent upon the amount of operating income and its effect on the rate attributable to the 50% disallowance for meals and entertainment, the impact of state rates on deferred tax assets and the sources of state taxable income. In addition, two items added a total of 13.0% to the Company's 1999 effective income tax rate: (1) settlement of several issues with the Canadian taxation authority and (2) the write off of unrealizable deferred tax assets. See Note 5 for additional discussion of these items. Net deferred income tax assets were $5.8 million at December 31, 1999 compared to $5.7 million at December 31, 1998. The Company has determined that no valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset is required as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, as the future realization of such tax benefits is considered to be more likely than not through the combination of carry back availability, certain tax- planning strategies that would allow for acceleration of deductible temporary differences to utilize remaining carry back availability and through expected future taxable income. Future taxable income must be approximately $6.3 million in order to realize the portion of deferred tax assets not realizable through carry back availability or tax-planning strategies. Year 2000 Issue: The Company's ability to conduct its day-to-day operations is dependent in part on an integrated software program and data-based system (collectively, the System). The System serves as a critical tool in carrying out functions in several key areas of the business, including contract management, sales, financial reporting and personnel administration. Early in 1998, the Company began to assess the System with respect to the Year 2000 (Y2K) issue. Additional Y2K work performed during 1999 focused on testing older PCs and on testing for imbedded chip issues in equipment and property that are unrelated to the information technology aspect of business operations. The Company spent less than $100,000 on Y2K compliance, excluding the cost of approximately 100 personal computers which are leased in the normal course of business. The Company experienced no major interruption of service from its suppliers and vendors, and no customers have advised the Company of Y2K problems that will prevent timely remittance of amounts owed. (a) Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Market Risk The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. The Company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage the above risks and the Company has not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. The Company's debt consists of working capital lines of credit, with various banks, having interest rates that float based on market rates. Therefore, the outstanding balances recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 1998 approximate fair value. These lines of credit are renegotiated annually. Item 8.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Shareholders and Board of Directors, Irex Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Irex Corporation (a Pennsylvania corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Irex Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index of financial statements is for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commissions's rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole. /S/ Arthur Andersen LLP Lancaster, Pennsylvania March 10, 2000 IREX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS December 31 ASSETS 1999 1998 CURRENT ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents (Note 8) $ 7,605,000 $ 10,485,000 Receivables, less reserves of $397,000 in 1999 and $399,000 in 1998 30,901,000 29,719,000 Inventories of materials and supplies, at the lower of cost (first-in, first- out) or market 459,000 512,000 Actual costs and estimated earnings on contracts in process in excess of billings (Notes 1 and 3)  4,870,000 3,750,000 Prepaid income taxes (Note 6) --- 2,398,000 Other prepaid expenses 286,000 194,000 Deferred income taxes (Notes 1 and 6) 3,221,000 2,543,000 Total current assets 47,342,000 49,601,000 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, at cost (Note 1): Land 133,000 133,000 Buildings and improvements 1,960,000 1,931,000 Machinery and equipment 4,085,000 4,223,000 6,178,000 6,287,000 Less - Accumulated depreciation (5,175,000) (5,288,000) 1,003,000 999,000 NOTE RECEIVABLE (Note 2) 3,684,000 3,500,000 DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (Notes 1 and 6) 2,559,000 3,147,000 OTHER ASSETS (Note 1) 757,000 624,000 $55,345,000 $57,871,000 December 31 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' INVESTMENT 1999 1998 CURRENT LIABILITIES: Notes payable to banks (Note 12) $ --- $ 629,000 Accounts payable 5,456,000 6,649,000 Billings in excess of actual costs and estimated earnings on contracts in process (Notes 1 and 3) 2,405,000 2,647,000 Accrued income taxes (Note 6) 2,197,000 --- Accrued workers' compensation insurance (Note 1) 2,337,000 2,342,000 Accrued liabilities (Note 15) 10,898,000 10,340,000 Total current liabilities 23,293,000 22,607,000 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES (Notes 1 and 16) 7,371,000 9,246,000 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Note 7) REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK, $1 par value; authorized 2,000,000 shares; issued and outstanding 244,703 shares in 1999 and 349,673 shares in 1998 (Note 14) 7,341,000 10,490,000 SHAREHOLDERS' INVESTMENT: Common stock $1 par value; authorized 2,000,000 shares; issued 1,028,633 shares in 1999 and 1998; outstanding 429,952 shares in 1999 and 431,802 shares in 1998 1,028,000 1,028,000 Paid-in surplus 533,000 537,000 Retained earnings 33,606,000 31,942,000 Cumulative translation adjustments (Note 1) (208,000) (292,000) Notes receivable (Note 10) (263,000) (372,000) 34,696,000 32,843,000 Treasury stock, 598,681 shares in 1999 and 596,831 shares in 1998, at cost (17,356,000) (17,315,000) Total shareholders' investment 17,340,000 15,528,000 $55,345,000 $57,871,000 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.

IREX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997 1. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES: The following summarizes the significant accounting policies employed by Irex Corporation (the Company) and subsidiaries. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Irex Corporation and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As a result of the spin-off effected on December 31, 1998 discussed in Note 2, the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1998 does not include the balance sheet of Specialty Products & Insulation Co. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation," gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions during the year are included in operating results, while gains and losses resulting from translation of the financial statements of the Company's Canadian subsidiary at the end of the year are reflected as cumulative translation adjustments in shareholders' investment. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses in 1999, 1998 and 1997 were not material. On January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" (SAS No. 130). SAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive income, as defined by SAS No. 130, is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in equity. The cumulative translation adjustments shown on the consolidated statements of shareholders' investment represent the total difference between net income and comprehensive income. Estimates and Assumptions: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Methods of Accounting for Revenues: Revenues from lump-sum basis construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract. This method is used because management considers this to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Revenues from time and material contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned. Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and contract settlements, result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Distribution and other revenues consist primarily of outright sales of purchased insulation and acoustical products (see Note 2). Reserves for Certain Self-Insured Business Risks: The Company is self-insured against a portion of its workers' compensation and other insurance risks. The process of determining reserve requirements for losses within its self-insured retention limits utilizes historical trends, involves an evaluation of claim frequency, severity and other factors and also includes the effect of future inflation. The Company measures the estimated liability for workers' compensation claims employing actuarial assumptions to discount to present value the estimated future payments for these claims, using a risk- free interest rate. The Company believes this method more accurately reflects the current impact on its financial condition of the future cash outflows. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the estimated undescended liability for workers' compensation claims was $6,156,000 and $7,352,000, respectively. The present value of such claims was $4,922,000 and $5,795,000, using a weighted average discount rate of 5.98% and 6.18%, respectively. The expected future payments as of December 31, 1999, on an undescended basis, are as follows: 2000 $ 1,581,000 2001 1,065,000 2002 703,000 2003 564,000 2004 395,000 2005 and thereafter 1,848,000 $ 6,156,000 Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of the Company's Canadian subsidia  ry since taxes payable upon distribution, net of foreign tax credits, are not expected to be significant. At December 31, 1999, the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings was $1,270,000. Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are depreciated using principally the straight- line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expressed as incurred. Classification Estimated Useful Lives Buildings 15 to 30 years Leasehold improvements 3 to 10 years Machinery and equipment 3 to 7 years Other Assets: For the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, other assets primarily consist of prepaid pension cost as a result of the curtailment discussed in Note 9. Non-Current Liabilities: Other long-term liabilities consist of the non-current portions of workers' compensation, insurance and postretirement benefit liabilities. Concentration of Business: Subsequent to the spin-off of its distribution subsidiary (see Note 2), the Company and its subsidiaries operate within the specialty contracting industry throughout the United States and Canada. For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues. The Company's contracting and distribution businesses purchase materials for use in contracts or resale from a limited number of major suppliers. Such concentration is normal for the industry and does not present an unreasonable risk or vulnerability to the Company. Approximately 21% of contracting revenues were derived from the power generation industry during the three-year period ended December 31, 1999. Management believes this concentration does not represent an unusual risk as contracts are widely dispersed by geography and customer. Pronouncements to be Adopted: During June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SAS 133). The Statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SAS 133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement, and requires that a company must formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment. SAS 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. A company may also implement the Statement as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance. The Statement cannot be applied retroactively. Management believes that the adoption of this Statement will not have a material impact on the financial statements. 2. SPIN-OFF OF SUBSIDIARY: On January 19, 1998, the Company announced its intention to spin off one of its subsidiaries, Specialty Products & Insulation Co. (SPI). The Company's Board of Directors (the Board), at its February 26, 1998 meeting, approved in principle the proposed transaction in which shareholders of Irex common stock received a dividend of SPI common stock through a pro rata distribution of 100% of SPI's capital stock (the Distribution). On December 16, 1998, the Board granted final approval of the spin-off to the Irex shareholders of all the common stock of SPI (the Spin-off). The Spin-off was effected on December 31, 1998 (the Closing Date) through the Distribution to the Company shareholders of record at the close of business on December 28, 1998. SPI distributed these shares on the basis of one share of SPI Stock for every fifty Irex shares held. SPI did not issue certificates for fractional shares in the distribution. Instead, it canceled such shares and issued cash in lieu of fractional shares at a rate of $2,698.09 per SPI share. No consideration was paid by the Irex shareholders for shares of SPI Stock. The Company received an opinion of counsel to the effect that the Distribution is not taxable to Irex and its shareholders for federal income tax purposes. However, cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of SPI Stock is taxable to the shareholders. Immediately prior to the Spin-off, SPI declared a dividend of $10.5 million, which was paid to the Company as the sole shareholder of SPI. The dividend was paid by means of $7.0 million in cash and $3.5 million of junior subordinated notes of SPI. The pay-in-kind notes bear interest at 10.5% and mature April 1, 2003. The company received interest income of $184,000 in the form of a pay-in-kind note during 1999. At the Closing Date, immediately prior to the Distribution, total assets of SPI were $66.3 million and total liabilities were $64.6 million. The net investment of the Company in SPI was $1.7 million at the Closing Date, immediately prior to the Distribution. The transaction was treated as a non-cash transaction in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Additionally, SPI repaid intercompany debt in the amount of $34.3 million immediately after the Spin-off. On the Closing Date, immediately following the Distribution, Evercore Capital Partners L.P., Evercore Capital Partners (NQ) L.P. and Evercore Capital Offshore Partners L.P. (collectively, Evercore), invested approximately $15.4 million in SPI in exchange for 7,113 shares of newly- issued SPI Common Stock at the purchase price of $2,158.46 per share. In addition, certain officers of SPI acquired 109 shares of newly-issued Common Stock. As a result of the Distribution and subsequent new investment, approximately 55% of SPI's Common Stock is owned by Irex shareholders and by SPI's management, and approximately 45% is owned by Evercore. As a result of the Spin-off, SPI is now a separate company, primarily concentrating on specialty product distribution/fabrication in the construction industry. The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries will continue to operate within the specialty contracting industry. The following pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income give effect to the Spin-off of SPI, and are presented as if the Spin-off had occurred as of January 1, 1997. The "Pro Forma" amounts represent the pro forma results of operations of the Company after giving effect to the dividend received from SPI and SPI's repayment of intercompany debt immediately after the Spin-off and the elimination of operating results attributable to SPI for the periods presented. The pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income may not be indicative of the results that would have been obtained had the Spin-off actually occurred on the date assumed nor is it necessarily indicative of the future consolidated results of operations. The Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1999 and 1998 do not include the balance sheet of SPI.

SPI's net sales to affiliates were approximately $6.5 million and $9.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. (b) This adjustment includes the elimination of the estimated costs, $206,000 in 1998 and approximately $830,000 in 1997, associated with Irex corporate personnel who became employees of SPI during March and April of 1998. The amount also reflects fee income from the computer services agreement under which SPI will pay a fee, approximating $610,000 in 1998 and 1997, to continue utilizing Irex's computer hardware, software and systems personnel for a period of three years. SPI has the option to terminate the computer services agreement after 18 months by notifying Irex six months prior to the date of termination. (c) This adjustment reflects the repayment of the Company's long-term debt and paydown of its borrowings under short-term credit facilities with funds received from SPI immediately after the Spin-off. 3.

Contract costs related to claims are carried at the lower of actual costs incurred or estimated net realizable value. 4. ACQUISITIONS: The Company completed one acquisition during 1999 for cash consideration of approximately $0.2 million. The acquisition included the stock of a company primarily engaged in the specialty contracting business and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The Company completed five acquisitions during 1998 for cash consideration and debt issued of approximately $9.7 million (plus the assumption of $1.9 million of debt). The acquisitions included the stock of two companies and certain assets of three additional companies, all of which are primarily engaged in the distribution business. The Company completed three acquisitions during 1997 for cash consideration of approximately $3.5 million. The acquisitions included the stock of one company and certain assets of two additional companies, all of which are primarily engaged in the distribution business. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the financial statements reflect the results of operations and cash flows of the operations from the dates of acquisitions. Had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, revenues and operating income would not have been materially different from reported results. The Company's distribution subsidiary completed the 1998 and 1997 acquisitions prior to the spin-off described in Note2. 5. FOURTH QUARTER MATTERS: During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company recognized income of $1.1 million related to the settlement of certain contingencies and reduced accruals by approximately $670,000 based on continued favorable experience with claims under its self-insurance programs. The settlement of the contingency was recorded as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expense and the favorable claims experience was recorded as a reduction to cost of revenues. In 1999, the Company's Canadian subsidiary settled several issues with the Canadian taxation authority. As a result of these settlements, the Company recorded additional income tax expense of $412,000 in the fourth quarter of 1999. Based on an analysis of the deferred tax accounts as of December 31, 1999, the Company determined that approximately $291,000 of the existing deferred tax assets were not realizable and wrote them off in the fourth quarter. 6. INCOME TAXES: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SAS 109). Deferred income taxes are computed based on the differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. The impact of changes in tax rates is reflected in income in the period in which the change is enacted. In conformity with SAS 109, deferred tax assets are classified based on the financial reporting classification of the related liabilities and assets which give rise to temporary book/tax differences. Deferred taxes relate to the following temporary differences: 1999 1998 Insurance reserves $ 5,696,000 $ 5,521,000 Bad debt reserves 151,000 133,000 Pension and other benefits (72,000) 7,000 Contracts 35,000 54,000 Other (30,000) (25,000) $ 5,780,000 $ 5,690,000 The Company has determined that no valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset is required as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, as the future realization of such tax benefits is considered to be more likely than not through the combination of carry back availability, certain tax planning strategies that would allow for acceleration of deductible temporary differences to utilize remaining carry back availability and through expected future taxable income. Income (loss) before income taxes is comprised of the following components: 1999 1998 1997 Domestic $5,673,000 $7,444,000 $4,390,000 Foreign (265,000) 1,100,000 108,000 $5,408,000 $8,544,000 $4,498,000 Income tax provision (benefit) consists of: 1999 1998 1997 Currently payable: Federal $1,658,000 $2,473,000 $1,028,000 State 939,000 170,000 260,000 Foreign 280,000 550,000 54,000 Total currently payable 2,877,000 3,193,000 1,342,000 Deferred: Federal 521,000 99,000 602,000 State (611,000) 710,000  21,000 Total deferred (90,000) 809,000 623,000 Total $2,787,000 $4,002,000(1) $1,965,000 (1) Excludes benefit of $211,000 from the extraordinary loss incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of long-term debt (see Note 12). The effective income tax rate is different from the statutory Federal income tax rate as indicated below: 1999 1998 1997 Statutory federal income tax rate 34.0% 34.0% 34.0% State income taxes ($328,000, $880,000 and $281,000), net of federal benefit 4.0 6.8 4.1 Meals and entertainment (50% disallowance) 1.8 2.4 4.5 Effects of foreign taxes (1.1) 2.1 0.4 Tax settlements (Note 5) 7.6 - - Write off unrealizable deferred tax assets (Note 5) 5.4 - - Other, net (0.2) 1.5 0.7 Effective income tax rate 51.5% 46.8% 43.7% The changes in the effective state income tax rate are due to the impact of state rate changes on deferred tax assets, as well as changes in the sources of the Company's state taxable income. 7. CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES: The Company's ACandS, Inc. subsidiary is one of a number of defendants in pending lawsuits filed by approximately 140,000 individual claimants seeking damages for injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos fibers in insulation products used at one time by ACandS in its business. ACandS has defenses to these actions, including defenses based on the fact it is primarily a contracting company in the business of installing products manufactured by others. During 1999, ACandS was served with cases involving 38,446 individual plaintiffs. In 1998, ACandS was served with cases involving 33,154 individual plaintiffs. There were 31,489 new plaintiffs in 1997, 37,777 new plaintiffs in 1996; and 44,904 new plaintiffs in 1995. The filing of numerous asbestos-related bodily injury claims against ACandS began in approximately 1978/1979, but new filings in any single year did not exceed 16,000 until 1993, and did not exceed 21,000 until 1995. The bulk of the litigation against ACandS is centered in a relatively small number of jurisdictions. In 1999, over 75 percent of new claims filed against ACandS came from Texas, Mississippi, Ohio, New York and Maryland. The pattern in 1998 was similar, with the same five states plus West Virginia accounting for over 80 percent of the filings. These jurisdictions have consistently produced heavy filings in recent years. It would appear that court rules and rulings favorable to claimants in these states encourage the filing of asbestos- related lawsuits. The great majority of the filings are apparently the result of screenings and other mass solicitation efforts. The lawsuits which result from such efforts are often filed with little investigation as to whether the claimants had any causative exposure to asbestos-containing products associated with any particular defendant. As the scope of the screening programs has increased, the degree of illness of the claimants seems to have diminished. However, the number of claims by individuals diagnosed with mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung often associated with asbestos exposure, has remained relatively constant. Since the beginning of 1981, approximately 194,000 individual claims against ACandS have been settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. ACandS's average cost for resolving those claims has been low. Over half of the claims were closed without any liability payment by ACandS. In recent years, the courts in many states have given priority to the resolution of more serious cases, such as claims by individuals diagnosed with mesothelioma. This has resulted in some large settlements of individual claims in states such as New York and Maryland. In addition, the litigation risk in jurisdictions which are difficult for defendants has lead ACandS to block settle large numbers of claims in Texas, West Virginia and other states. ACandS's average disposition cost per claim increased significantly in 1998, and increased again in 1999, largely as a result of sums paid in settlement of the more serious cases. The absence of bankrupt manufacturers as defendants has apparently contributed to the increase in ACandS's disposition costs. Asbestos-related bodily injury cases filed against ACandS in federal court have been transferred since July, 1991 to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pretrial handling. Efforts toward a national solution of the asbestos litigation problem have been undertaken in this multidistrict proceeding, but none has been successful. Currently, certain asbestos defendants are supporting national legislation which would establish a comprehensive administrative program to handle asbestos-related claims. ACandS has been informed that the prospects for such legislation are uncertain at best. The defense of the cases pending against ACandS is now being handled by the Travelers Property Casualty Corp. with the participation of other insurers that wrote coverage for ACandS. Virtually all of ACandS's liability and defense costs for these cases are being paid by ACandS's insurance carriers. ACandS through final settlement agreements has secured the commitment of a substantial amount of the considerable insurance coverage it has for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. ACandS believes it will secure additional coverage, if needed, from those insurers which have not to date settled with ACandS. One of the insurers with a continuing obligation to contribute coverage for ACandS has encountered financial difficulties in recent years, in part because of asbestos and environmental liabilities, but ACandS does not believe these difficulties will affect the adequacy of the coverage available to it. It has been more than 25 years since ACandS adopted the policy that it would not resell, use or install asbestos-containing insulation products. Given the length of time since this policy was established, the increased numbers of new claims in the last five years and the increase in disposition cost averages in 1998 and 1999 are troubling developments. The combination of increased filings and higher disposition costs has resulted in escalating annual settlement expenditures by ACandS's insurers. As a result, the rate of exhaustion of ACandS's insurance coverage has increased. The complexity of the asbestos-related disease litigation makes prediction of future events difficult. Nevertheless, ACandS continues to effectively defend asbestos-related bodily injury cases, and anticipates that its average disposition costs will remain low in the context of the litigation. Despite the closing of 194,000 claims, the bulk of ACandS's insurance coverage remains available. Management, therefore, believes that ACandS's insurance coverage is adequate to ensure that these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the long-term business or financial position of the Company. ACandS is one of a number of defendants in three actions by the owners of buildings to recover costs associated with the replacement or treatment of installed asbestos-containing products, one of which is an alleged class action. One hundred three such cases against ACandS have been dismissed and 17 have been settled. No new building-related cases have been served on ACandS since 1994. ACandS believes that its exposure in the three remaining cases is limited. Insurance for the asbestos in building cases is being provided by Travelers Property Casualty Corp. Although that part of the coverage for these cases obtained from policies written by Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. (now part of Travelers) has been provided under a reservation of rights as to the availability and amount of the coverage, necessary insurance payments have been and continue to be made. Based on the rulings to date of courts which have considered the availability of insurance coverage for asbestos in building claims, ACandS does not anticipate significant problems concerning insurance for settled or pending claims. Accordingly, ACandS believes that the asbestos in building claims will not have a material adverse effect on the long-term business or financial condition of the Company. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are also parties as both plaintiff and defendant to various claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, including claims concerning work performed under various contracts. In the opinion of management, claims and litigation resulting in the normal course of business will not materially affect the Company's long- term business, financial position or results of operations. 8. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash balances in 1999, 1998 and 1997 was not material. The Company's income tax and interest payments are summarized below: 1999 1998 1997 Income taxes (net of refunds) $147,000 $3,560,000 $1,708,000 Interest $125,000 $3,013,000 $2,005,000 9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS: Defined Benefit Pension Plan: The Company and its subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of their salaried employees. The benefits under the plan are based on years of service and salary levels. The Company's policy is to fund pension costs in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Company's Board of Directors (Board) adopted a resolution to amend the defined benefit pension plan effective May 1, 1998. The amendment suspends the plan, thereby freezing the accrued benefits of all plan participants and discontinuing future benefit accruals. Under the provisions of SAS No. 88, "Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," freezing the benefits resulted in the recognition of a curtailment gain of $869,000 in 1998 for the decrease in the Company's benefit obligation. The gain was reported in the Company's consolidated statement of income as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in benefit payments from $428,000 in 1998 to $856,000 in 1999 is primarily attributable to lump sum payments that were made to terminated vested participants. When the Company spun off its distribution subsidiary at the end of 1998 (see Note 2), all of the subsidiary's active participants in the pension plan became terminated participants at that time. Under the provisions of the Company's pension plan, terminated participants eligible for lump sum payments of less than $3,500 were cashed out during 1999 and those with lump sum values between $3,500 and $10,000 were given the option to elect an immediate lump sum distribution. Terminated participants with lump sum values in excess of $10,000 remain vested terminated participants of the Company's pension plan. Actuarially computed net pension expense includes the following components: 1999 1998 1997 Service cost-benefits earned during the period $ --- $185,000 $517,000 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 595,000 573,000 551,000 Expected return on plan assets (617,000) (614,000) (631,000) Amortization of prior service cost --- (3,000) (8,000) Recognized net actuarial loss (gain) 16,000 (20,000) (33,000) Effect of curtailment gain --- 869,000) --- Net pension expense $ (6,000) $(748,000) $396,000 The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1999 and 1998: 1999 1998 Change in projected benefit obligation: Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $10,519,000 $ 8,760,000 Service cost --- 185,000 Interest cost 595,000 573,000 Benefit payments (856,000) (286,000) Actuarial (gain) loss (980,000) 3,651,000 Projected benefit obligation before special events 9,278,000 12,883,000 Curtailments --- (2,364,000) Projected benefit obligation at end of year 9,278,000 10,519,000 Change in fair value of plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 10,871,000 8,759,000 Employer contributions --- 775,000 Benefit payments (856,000) (428,000) Actual return on assets 658,000 1,765,000 Fair value of plan assets at end of year 10,673,000 10,871,000 Funded status 1,395,000 352,000 Unrecognized net actuarial loss (gain) (708,000) 330,000 Prepaid benefit cost $ 687,000 $ 682,000 Assumptions used were: 1999 1998 Weighted average discount rates 6.15% 5.75% Rates of increase in future compensation levels N/A N/A Expected long-term rate of return on assets 5.75% 6.70% A substantial number of the hourly employees of the Company's subsidiaries are covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained, multiemployer pension plans. The Company contributed approximately $7,081,000 in 1999, $5,736,900 in 1998, and $5,297,000 in 1997 to such plans. Information is not available from the plans' administrators to permit the Company to determine its share of the unfunded vested benefits of these plans. Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions: In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company and its subsidiaries provide certain health care benefits under company-sponsored plans for the majority of retired salaried employees. Active salaried employees who were at least age 55 and had 10 years of consecutive service at January 1, 1990 are eligible for these benefits upon retirement. Also, active salaried employees of the Company whose age plus years of service equaled at least 55 at January 1, 1990 are eligible for these benefits upon retirement when they attain age 62 as long as such employees have either 20 years of service or their age plus years of service equals 90 upon retirement. Cash payments of up to $60.00 per month are given to retirees over age 65 to purchase supplemental Medicare coverage. Eligible retirees under age 65 are fully covered by the Company's insurance plan. The number of retirees under age 65 currently participating in the plan is not significant. The expected cost of these benefits is charged to expense during the years that the employees render service. The transition obligation is being amortized over 20 years. Actuarially computed net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following components: 1999 1998 1997 Service cost- benefits earned during the period $ 4,000 $ 5,000 $ 6,000 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 51,000 61,000 68,000 Amortization of transition obligation 48,000 48,000 48,000 Recognized net actuarial gain (32,000) (26,000) (30,000) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost $ 71,000 $ 88,000 $ 92,000 The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1999 and 1998: 1999 1998 Change in projected benefit obligation: Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 883,000 $ 927,000 Service cost 4,000 5,000 Interest cost 51,000 61,000 Benefit payments (100,000) (100,000) Actuarial gain (87,000) (10,000) Projected benefit obligation at end of year 751,000 883,000 Change in fair value of plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year --- --- Employer contributions 100,000 100,000 Benefit payments (100,000) (100,000) Fair value of plan assets at end of year --- --- Funded status (751,000) (883,000) Unrecognized transition obligation 625,000 673,000 Unrecognized net actuarial gain (327,000) (272,000) Accrued benefit cost $ (453,000) $(482,000) For measurement purposes, a 13% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for calendar 1997; the rate was assumed to decrease to 10% for the years 1998 through 2000, decrease again to 7% in 2001 and remain level thereafter. Due to the provisions of the plan, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would not have a significant impact on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1999. The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.75% and 6.75% at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Other: The Company and its subsidiaries have incentive compensation plans covering substantially all of their officers and key employees. Incentive compensation for 1999 and 1998 was primarily based on after-tax earnings in excess of the cost of capital. For 1997, the Company and each of its subsidiaries used a separate measurement basis to determine incentive compensation. Rate of return on assets, earnings before interest and taxes and after-tax earnings in excess of the cost of capital each served as the basis in one of the various incentive plans. Total incentive compensation expense was $2,201,000 for 1999, $3,831,000 for 1998, and $2,337,000 for 1997. The Company and its contracting subsidiaries also maintain a defined contribution savings incentive 401(k) plan covering substantially all U. S. salaried employees. During 1999, the Company's hourly non-union employees became eligible to participate in the savings incentive plan. Effective June 1, 1998, the Company's distribution subsidiary created a separate 401(k) plan for its salaried employees. Contributions to the savings incentive plan are based on specified percentages of employee contributions to the plan. Expense for these plans was $634,000 in 1999, $835,000 in 1998, and $616,000 in 1997. Prior to May 1, 1998, the Company also maintained an employee stock ownership (ESOP) plan. On this date, however, the Board adopted a resolution which merged the ESOP plan into the 401(k) plan. The resolution stipulates that (a) no future contributions be made to the ESOP, (b) prior ESOP balances become 100 percent vested and (c) account balances be held as a component of the 401(k) plan but no longer be designed to invest primarily in Company securities. Contributions to the ESOP plan were discretionary and the Company recorded no expense for the plan in 1998 and 1997. 10. STOCK OPTION PLANS: Shareholders approved, via proxy vote at the Company's April 29, 1999 Annual Meeting, a Board resolution for a new Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (the New Plan). The New Plan granted 2,500 options for each non-employee director and 3,750 options for the Chairman of the Board on January 1, 1999. The options carry an exercise price of $35.96, which is in excess of the fair market value of the stock, and therefore, no compensation expense was recorded. Options vest in equal increments over a five-year period on January 1 of each year beginning January 1, 1999 providing the Director is a director as of that date; or they vest in total in the event of a major corporate transaction. New non-employee directors or a new chairman of the board would receive options for the balance of the five-year program consistent with their position and offset by a reduction in their predecessors' vested shares. These later options would be granted at no less than the original strike price (i.e. $35.96) or such higher strike price as may be determined by the Board. Prior to January 2, 1998, the Company maintained two non-qualified stock option plans (the Former Plans) which provided for the issuance to key employees and outside directors of up to 80,000 options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. Generally, options outstanding under the Company's Former Plans: (i) were granted at prices which equated to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, (ii) vested over periods of one to three years, and (iii) expired ten years subsequent to date of grant. On January 2, 1998 the Former Plan applicable to outside directors terminated under the provisions specifying that options be granted January 1 of each year for a five-year period beginning January 1, 1994. Following is a summary of the status of the number of stock options as of December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, and the activity during the year ended on those dates, along with the range of exercise prices for options outstanding at year end: 1999 1998 1997 Wgtd.

As provided for in the statement, the Company elected to continue the intrinsic value method of expense recognition. Had compensation cost for the stock option plans been determined using the fair value method prescribed by SAS 123, the Company's net income applicable to common stock and net income per common share would approximate the proforma amounts below: 1999 1998 1997 Net Income Applicable to Common Stock As reported $1,664,000 $3,232,000 $1,553,000 Proforma $1,446,000 $3,226,000 $1,534,000 Net Income Per Common Share As reported - Basic $ 3.85 $ 7.75 $ 4.05 As reported - Diluted $ 3.85 $ 7.70 $ 4.00 Proforma - Basic $ 3.35 $ 7.73 $ 4.00 Proforma - Diluted $ 3.35 $ 7.69 $ 3.95 The proforma effect of applying SAS 123 in this disclosure for 1999, 1998 and 1997 is not necessarily representative of the proforma amounts for future years.

During 1998, employees and directors of the Company exercised a total of 37,850 stock options granted in the years 1990 through 1995. On February 26, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors passed a resolution that all employee stock options granted in 1996 and 1997 and director options granted in 1998 became fully vested immediately. Subsequent to the Board's action, employees and directors of the Company exercised an additional 18,000 stock options which had been granted in 1996, 1997 and 1998. The Company received a note in lieu of cash for approximately 25% of the options exercised during 1998. The table below sets forth the year of grant for those options exercised during 1998: Year Granted Number Exercised 1990 through 1994 34,850 1995 3,000 1996 6,200 1997 7,800 1998 4,000 11. INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: In 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SAS) No. 128 "Earnings Per Share." SAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures. The Company's basic income per share is calculated as income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For diluted income per share, income available to common shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the incremental number of shares added as a result of converting common stock equivalents, as calculated using the treasury stock method. The Company's common stock equivalents consist solely of outstanding stock options. Average Per-Share Income Shares Amount FOR THE YEAR ENDED 1999 Income per Common Share - Basic Income available to common shareholders $1,664,000 431,871 $ 3.85 Options issued to Employees and Directors (Note 10) --- --- Income per Common Share - Diluted Income available to common shareholders $1,664,000 431,871 $ 3.85 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 1998 Income per Common Share - Basic Income before extraordinary items $3,563,000 417,163 $ 8.54 available to common shareholders Extraordinary items (331,000) (0.79) Income available to common shareholders $3,232,000 $ 7.75 Options issued to Directors (Note 10) 2,467 Income per Common Share - Diluted Income before extraordinary items available to common shareholders $3,563,000 419,630 $ 8.49 Extraordinary items (331,000) (0.79) Income available to common shareholders $3,232,000 $ 7.70 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 1997 Income per Common Share - Basic Income available to common shareholders $1,553,000 383,859 $ 4.05 Options issued to Employees and Directors (Note 10) --- 4,683 Income per Common Share - Diluted Income available to common shareholders $1,553,000 388,542 $ 4.00 Options to purchase approximately 21,250 shares of common stock at $35.96 per share and 20,100 shares of common stock at $31 per share were outstanding during 1999 and 1997, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares. 12. BORROWINGS: Bank Borrowings: At December 31, 1999, the Company had unsecured credit facilities with several banks totaling $22,500,000. These facilities provide for borrowings under lines of credit and letters of credit. These borrowings were repaid in January of 1999 and there were no additional borrowings during the year. At December 31, 1999, there were no outstanding borrowings under the secured lines of credit. There was availability under these unsecured credit facilities for additional borrowings of $15,974,000 at December 31, 1999. These unsecured credit facilities are renegotiated annually and bear interest at not more than the prime rate. (The weighted average interest rate was 6.7% at December 31, 1998.) In addition, the Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined in the respective agreements. The Company maintains deposits at several banks, which serve various corporate purposes including the support of its lines of credit available or in use. Long-Term Debt: There was no long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1999 and 1998. As a result of the spin-off of the Company's distribution subsidiary (see Note 2), the Company was required to repay the 9% unsecured senior notes. The Company incurred a prepayment penalty of $499,000. This amount, along with the writeoff of the remaining deferred financing costs, is reflected as an extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt in the Company's consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 1998. 13. LEASE COMMITMENTS: The Company leases warehouses, sales offices and computer equipment under noncancelable lease agreements. Rental expense for all operating leases was $1,717,000 in 1999, $7,082,000 in 1998, and $5,877,000 in 1997. As of December 31, 1999, the future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable leases that have terms in excess of one year are as follows: 2000 $ 641,000 2001 269,000 2002 135,000 2003 20,000 Subsequent years --- Total minimum rental obligations $1,065,000 14. REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK: During 1992, the Company offered to exchange one share of preferred stock with a par value of $1 per share for each share of the Company's outstanding common stock up to a maximum of 350,000 common shares (the Offer). A total of 349,864 common shares were exchanged in December 1992 in accordance with the Offer. Dividends on the preferred stock accrue at an annual rate of $2.80 per share. Such dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears commencing January 1, 1993. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had accrued $171,000 and $137,000, respectively, for such dividends. In the foreseeable future, the Company does not expect to pay cash dividends on the outstanding common shares at December 31, 1999. The preferred stock is nonvoting except in certain circumstances. On or after February 1, 1998, the Company may, at its option, redeem the preferred stock, in whole or in part, initially at $31.50 per share and declining to $30 per share on and after February 1, 2003, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Prior to February 1, 2013, the Company will not have the right to redeem shares of preferred stock which have been continuously owned beneficially by the holder thereof since the issuance of the preferred stock in connection with the Offer, if such holder elects to prohibit such redemption. On December 1, 1998, and on each December 1 thereafter through and including December 1, 2012, the Company will be obligated to redeem shares of the preferred stock that any holders thereof have requested the Company to redeem at $30 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, subject to an annual limitation on the number of shares that the Company will be obligated to redeem. The Company's Board, at its April 29, 1999 meeting, authorized a call of up to 160,256 shares of Preferred Stock at a call price of $31.20 per share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends on such stock through June 30, 1999. The Company redeemed 104,953 shares as a result of the call. The redemption of 104,269 shares was recorded in the second quarter and the redemption of an additional 684 shares was recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 1999. All shares of Preferred Stock held of record as of May 14, 1999 were subject to the call, except that the Company did not have the right to redeem shares of Preferred Stock which had been continuously and beneficially owned by the holder since the issuance of the Preferred Stock in connection with the Offer, if such holder elected to prohibit the redemption. The shares purchased by the Company pursuant to this call will count against the Company's obligation to repurchase 1/15th of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock each year upon the request of preferred shareholders. The price for future calls for redemption declines to $30.90 on February 1, 2000 and by $0.30 each February 1 thereafter until it reaches $30.00 on February 1, 2003. The preferred stock has a liquidation value of $30 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. The payment of dividends on, and the redemption of, the preferred stock may be restricted by the terms of Company loan agreements or by the terms of future financing arrangements. 15. ACCRUED LIABILITIES: The components of accrued liabilities as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 are as follows: 1999 1998 Salaries and wages $ 2,928,000 $ 2,744,000 General, auto and other liability insurance 5,216,000 3,560,000 Other 2,754,000 4,036,000 $10,898,000 $10,340,000 16. NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES: The components of non-current liabilities as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 are as follows: 1999 1998 Workers compensation and other insurance $6,966,000 $8,735,000 Retirement benefits 405,000 511,000 $7,371,000 $9,246,000 17. SEGMENT REPORTING: The Company adopted SAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", during the fourth quarter of 1998. SAS No. 131 establishes standards for public companies to report certain information about operating se  gments in annual financial statements and also requires that selected information about operating segments be included in interim financial reports to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, including the geographic areas in which business is conducted. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available, and whose operating results are regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker (or group that functions in such capacity) in assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company's chief operating decision-making group is the Management Council which, prior to the spin-off of its distribution subsidiary (see Note 2), consisted of the Company's president (Chief Executive Officer), two senior vice presidents (General Counsel/Secretary and Finance/Administration) and the presidents of each of the Company's operating subsidiaries. After the spin-off, a senior vice president of the contracting group replaced the President of the Company's former distribution subsidiary as a member of the Management Council. Prior to the spin-off of SPI, the Company consisted of two distinct strategic business units: a specialty contracting group and a distribution/fabrication group. Subsequent to the December 31, 1998 spin-off, the Company's only business unit is the specialty contracting group. The Company's reportable operating segments for the year ended December 31, 1998 include Distribution, Contracting and Other. The Distribution segment consists of SPI, which is primarily a distributor and fabricator of mechanical insulation, architectural/acoustical products and specialty products. The Contracting segment includes wholly owned subsidiaries, which primarily engage in mechanical insulation, abatement, fire protection and interior finish contracting. The Other segment consists of the parent company which provides various administrative and management services to the Distribution and Contracting segments and a Delaware investment company. As a result of the spin-off of the Distribution unit on December 31, 1998, the Company no longer has reportable segments The accounting policies of the operating segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies except that the separate financial results for the operating segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which management internally allocates costs associated with the Company's central administration and support. Central administrative costs are allocated for the purpose of assisting in making internal operating decisions. The Company evaluates performance based on net income of the operating segments and generally accounts for intersegment sales as if the sales were made to third parties at current market prices.

SPI's total assets at December 31, 1998 were $66.3 million. (b) The Distribution and Contracting segments, in addition to the parent company, have indebtedness with IFC in the form of long-term unsecured notes. SPI's note was repaid December 31, 1998 as a condition of the spin-off discussed in Note 2. The parent company also provides a borrowing facility for the Distribution and Contracting segments, which receive credit for cash deposited or charges for working capital needed. Based upon activity within the intercompany account, the Distribution and Contracting segments are charged interest expense. (c) The elimination of segment assets consists primarily of intercompany receivables.  Item 9. Disagreements on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not Applicable PART III Item 10.

(2) Includes amounts earned under the Company's Savings Incentive Plan. Savings Incentive Plan: The Company offers a Savings Incentive Plan for all salaried employees whereby they can elect to contribute up to 15% of their salary and incentive compensation into accounts in their names which are independently managed and invested. Effective January 1, 1999, the Savings Incentive Plan was amended to allow participation by hourly employees not subject to retirement benefits under a collective bargaining agreement. Pursuant to amendments adopted by the Board of Directors which became effective January 1, 1985, the employees' contributions to the Plan were made in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. (The Company match is 125% of the first 3% of employee contributions and 75% of the next 3% of employee contributions. One-fourth of the Company's match is subject to the Company achieving a specific financial performance target.) Employee Stock Ownership Plan: Prior to May 1, 1998, the Company also maintained an employee stock ownership (ESOP) plan. On this date, however, the Board adopted a resolution which merged the ESOP plan into the 401(k) plan. The resolution stipulates that (a) no future contributions be made to the ESOP, (b) prior ESOP balances become 100 percent vested and (c) account balances be held as a component of the 401(k) plan but no longer be designed to invest primarily in Company securities. Effective May 1, 1998, this Plan was merged into the Savings Incentive Plan. On December 31, 1999, there were 600 employees of the Company and its subsidiaries eligible to participate in the Savings Incentive Plan and a total of 43,136 shares of common stock were held by such Plan. (3) Mr. Andrew is included in his capacity as President of a major wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. (4) Mr. Gray is included in his capacity as Vice President of a major wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Stock Option Plans: On February 28, 1990, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Irex Corporation Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan under which options to purchase not more than 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be granted over the next ten years to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The number of shares available for options was reduced during 1995 from 200,000 shares to 55,000 shares. The recipients of options and the number of options granted to them are determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee, no option may be exercised before three years nor more than ten years after the date of grant. On February 26, 1998, the Board of Directors eliminated the three-year vesting requirement with respect to options granted during 1996 and 1997. On July 20, 1994, the Board of Directors amended the plan to provide that Fair Market Value on the date of the grant shall be defined as (i) the mean between the highest and lowest prices of actual sales of Shares on the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed on such date, or, (ii) if there are no such sales on such date, the mean between the closing bid and asked prices of the Shares on such exchange on such date, or, (iii) if the Shares are not listed on any national securities exchange, the mean between the closi  ng high bid and low asked prices of the Shares in over-the-counter trading as identified by the National Quotation Bureau or other comparable source selected by the Committee, or (iv) if the Committee determines that the mean is not an accurate reflection of the market value of the Shares, the fair market value as determined for purposes of the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, less a discount reflecting the lack of liquidity of Shares in the open market, or, (v) if the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan has terminated, or has failed to provide a current valuation of the Shares for any other reason, the fair market value as determined by a disinterested third party selected by the Committee and qualified to perform an evaluation of the Shares. Prior to this amendment, the option price was established at the fair market value as determined for purposes of the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, less a discount reflecting the lack of liquidity of shares in the open market. No options were granted under the terms of the Plan during 1999. Retirement Income Plan Table: The Company's Retirement Income Plan which became effective September 1, 1984, covers all salaried employees. All costs are paid by the Company, and the amount of retirement income is determined by the career average rate of compensation and length of credited service at retirement. Effective January 1, 1989, the Plan provides for an annual benefit based on 1% of annual compensation up to the Social Security covered compensation level and 1.5% of compensation over that level. The Retirement Income Plan in effect prior to the adoption of this Plan provided for benefits based on the final five years average compensation and length of service at retirement. Assets of the former Plan sufficient to fund all accrued benefits under that Plan for participants were used to purchase annuities for the participants or transferred to the participants' accounts in the Savings Incentive Plan. Effective May 1, 1998, the Retirement Income Plan was suspended, thereby freezing the accrued benefits of all plan participants and discontinuing future benefit accruals. The following table sets forth required Pension Plan information for the Chief Executive Officer and the four other most highly compensated executive officers.

Hipolit 1,176 21,360 Jane E. Pinkerton 7,500 14,568 David F. Andrew 9,695 20,028 Dennis R. Gray - 13,584 Compensation of Directors: All Directors who are not officers of the Company receive an annual fee of $9,500 and $750 per board meeting attended. The Board of Directors has one committee, Finance and Audit, and outside directors on that committee receive $750 per committee meeting attended. Directors who are officers of the Company or its subsidiaries receive no additional compensation for attendance at meetings of the board or board committees. The Chairman of the Board of the Company receives an additional annual fee of $20,500, of which $3,000 shall be paid in Irex common stock. In addition to the compensation outlined above, each Director who was not an officer of the company received 50 shares of Irex Common Stock as compensation for a special strategic planning meeting held during 1999. On April 28, 1994, the shareholders approved a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors of the Company. This plan terminated on January 2, 1998. On April 29, 1999, the shareholders approved a new Non- Qualified Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors. This new plan provides for the grant of 2,500 options for each non-employee director and 3,750 options for the Chairman of the Board on January 1, 1999. The options carry an exercise price of $35.96, the Company's book value as of that date. Options vest in equal increments over a five-year period on January 1 of each year beginning January 1, 1999 providing the Director is a director as of that date; or they vest in total in the event of a major corporate transaction. New non-employee directors or a new Chairman of the Board would receive options for the balance of the five year program consistent with their positions and offset by a reduction in their predecessors' vested shares. These later options would be granted at no less than the original strike price of $35.96 or such higher strike price as may be determined by the Board. Each option expires ten years from its date of grant, or five years from the date an optionee ceases to be a member of the Board. A total of not more than 25,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be issued under this new plan. Item 12.
