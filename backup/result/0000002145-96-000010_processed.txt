BUSINESS ______________________________________________________________________ NOTE: References to a fiscal year in this Form 10-K are to Action Industries, Inc.'s fiscal year ending for the five most recent fiscal years on June 30, 1996, June 24, 1995, June 25, 1994, June 26, 1993, and June 27, 1992. Unless otherwise indicated, information is presented for continuing operations. GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUSINESS - FIVE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 1996 Sale of Operating Assets. The Company has entered into an agreement to sell its inventory and related intellectual property associated with its Replenishment (Powerhouse) business (sold October 18, 1996), and pending the approval of its shareholders, to also sell the inventories and intellectual property related to its Promotional business on or about mid to late December 1996 or early January 1997. If approved by the shareholders and consummated, this transaction will result in the sale of substantially all of the operating assets currently employed in the Company's business. Assets remaining would be the Company's trade receivables and several notes and other non-trade receivables relating to prior asset dispositions and a prior sale/leaseback transaction. With the assistance of its investment bankers, the Company is actively exploring other strategic options available to it, including business combinations with other operating businesses, in order to continue as an operating concern and preserve all or a portion of its income tax net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has had indications of interest from third parties for a business combination of this type. Discussions are in process with interested third parties, but such discussions are preliminary and may not result in an agreement relating to any such transaction. The events which have led to the decision to sell the current operations are described in the following paragraphs. Organization and Business. The organization and business of Action Industries, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") have undergone significant changes beginning in fiscal 1990 and continuing through fiscal 1996 in connection with a major restructuring effort and the Company's response to declining sales. The Company has experienced declining sales in its traditional promotional business each year since 1989. The Company implemented a restructuring plan in 1990 including various activities intended to return the Company to sales growth or stability and profitability. The Company focused on its core business and sold or eliminated those noncore business units and assets which were not profitable or were not consistent with these objectives. Almost continuous downsizing efforts have been made over the years since 1990 to reduce merchandise inventories and the Company's reliance on working capital borrowings, and to reduce personnel and other operating costs in order to compensate for the decline in sales. The strategy has also encompassed reduction of low margin business, including reduction of guaranteed sale business, which has contributed to the decline in sales. While progress was made initially and at other times over the years, the Company has not been able to make sufficient progress overall to improve or even maintain its position in the retail marketplace. In fiscal 1995 the Company implemented plans to close its plastics manufacturing facility and to sell its lamp business, consistent with the focus on the core business. These transactions were completed in August and September of 1995 respectively, and were recorded in the financial statements as of June 24, 1995. The Company's retail store in Holland, Michigan was closed in September 1995. In September of 1995 the Company announced the resignation of R. Craig Kirsch as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. T. Ronald Casper was appointed Acting President and Chief Executive Officer and Joel M. Berez was elected Chairman of the Board. In fiscal year 1996 the Company agreed in principle to terminate the lease on its headquarters office/warehouse facility (where it has been the sole tenant) and to enter into a new lease as a tenant for significantly reduced space in this facility in the form of office space only. The Company has operated its business from public warehouses since February of 1996. A new operating lease arrangement was signed in October 1996. The new lease will eliminate the Company's substantial commitment under the prior arrangement, which will materially reduce (but not eliminate) the Company's future occupancy costs. In addition the new arrangements are expected to provide the Company's landlord in the facility with the ability to refinance or resell the property in two to five years such that the Company could realize some or all of the $2.3 million reduced principal portion of what was originally a $3.5 million note receivable due to the Company from its sale/leaseback of the facility in 1991. This note has not been recorded as an asset in the accompanying financial statements, as a result of the uncertainties associated with its realization, both past and present. In fiscal 1996 the decline in sales continued, principally due to decreased sales to two of the Company's largest customers of fiscal 1995 (a $6.1 million decrease from $8.8 million in sales last year to $2.7 million in sales in the current year). Sales to three other customers decreased $1.8 million as a result of those customers discontinuing their businesses. In addition, approximately $1.5 million in sales to customers in Mexico and Canada last year were not repeated in the current year as a result of the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. Replenishment (Powerhouse) sales decreased $2.8 million related to new store setup business last year which was not repeated or replaced in the current year, and reduced order fill rates related to the Company's significant reduction in inventory levels in the current year. In general, the Company's reduced inventory levels and capital constraints limited inventory purchasing and resulted in reduced order fill rates and the inability to introduce new programs. The implementation of the strategy to reduce guaranteed sale business, which is particularly applicable to the Company's seasonal Gift business, was the major contributor to decreased Gift sales in fiscal 1995 and 1996 as compared to 1994 and prior years. Many of the reasons for the continuation in the decline in sales in fiscal 1996 are symptomatic of the inability of the Company to maintain its past market position. During fiscal 1996 continued declining sales and increasing operating losses resulted in the Company aggressively accelerating its inventory reduction plan, further downsizing of the operating infrastructure, and the assessment that significant improvements in sales and profitability were necessary in order to provide sufficient liquidity to continue to operate the business. In response to this assessment, the Company engaged an investment banking firm to assist in identifying, analyzing and pursuing possible strategic alternatives for potential business combinations involving substantially all of the business, operating assets or stock of the Company. Working with its advisors, the Company determined that there was little or no possibility of raising the additional debt and/or equity capital that would be necessary to finance a turnaround or further restructuring of the business. The Company and its advisors also determined that the sale of the business in its entirety was not a viable strategic alternative. The investment bankers located an opportunity to sell the Company's inventory and intangible assets related to the operation of the business. The Company has determined that this sale is in its best interest in comparison to the continued operation of the business and the anticipated losses which such continued operation would almost assuredly bring. This sale is believed to be the only currently available alternative to a liquidation of the business, and is considered preferable to a liquidation. Restructuring charges of $5.1 million were recorded in fiscal 1993, including severance and other personnel costs associated with downsizing, and the writeoff of inventories and computer software costs. Also related to restructuring, the Company sold substantially all the assets of Action Nicholson Color Company (ANC), a wholly-owned subsidiary, in April of 1994. ANC has been reported as a discontinued operation. Other restructuring activities have included the liquidation of Action Tungsram, Inc., an affiliated company, and the sale/leaseback of the Company's headquarters which was completed in fiscal 1991. Further, the September 1995 sale of the lamp business and August 1995 closing of the plastics manufacturing operation were reported in the financial statements for fiscal 1995. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND MARKETING SEGMENT The Company is the successor to a business which was founded in 1917 and incorporated in 1946. In 1969 the Company first sold its common stock in the public market. For more than thirty years the Company's principal business has been the sale of comprehensive promotional programs to retailers, including DOLLAR-AMA and others. More recently, the Company introduced ACTION EXPRESS and POWER PALLET and other similar programs designed to provide a broad range of value-oriented products, programs, displays and services to meet the traditional promotional objectives of the retailer and reduce the need for in-store labor. The Company's focus has been on its core promotional business consisting of two distinct business-marketing units designed to meet the needs of both its retail customers and the consumer as follows: 1. "Core" Promotional Business, which concentrates on the development of innovative promotional programs designed to increase sales and profitability for the retail industry. 2. Replenishment (Powerhouse), which focuses on a "store within a store" concept using a combination of promotional programs, themed events, and other selected items. The sale of the Company's lamp business in September of 1995 substantially eliminated the Specialty Products business, which had been the Company's "Item" business, wherein proprietary branded lines of merchandise were sold independent of any promotional programs. The principal product categories sold by the Company have been housewares (kitchenware, cleaning aids, food storage), plastic products for the home, picture frames, toys, stationery, closet accessories, health and beauty aids and the like. In fiscal 1996 one of the Company's customers accounted for 18.2% of consolidated net sales as a result of the merger of what had been two separate customers which individually accounted for 9.2% and 9% of consolidated net sales respectively. In fiscal 1995 one of these two customers accounted for 11.6% of consolidated net sales. In fiscal 1994 another customer accounted for 15.3% of consolidated net sales. Business with the 1994 large customer decreased significantly in fiscal 1995, as a result of the customer's narrowing its business with the Company to smaller/older stores in fiscal 1995. The Company has several large customers, however, which are significant to its business. In fiscal 1996 the Company sold in excess of $1 million to each of 6 customers who, in the aggregate, accounted for 42% of consolidated net sales. In fiscal 1995 the Company sold in excess of $1 million to each of 11 customers who, in the aggregate, accounted for 48% of consolidated net sales. In fiscal 1994 the Company sold in excess of $1 million to each of 19 customers who, in the aggregate, accounted for 57% of consolidated net sales. The loss of large customers has had an adverse effect on the Company. There are no long-term arrangements or contracts which obligate any customer to purchase from the Company. The Company generally receives firm orders from its customers only a short time before shipment and consequently has no significant dollar amount of backlog of firm orders. In its promotional retail marketing programs (DOLLAR-AMA [registered trademark], deep discount Gift promotions, ACTION EXPRESS [registered trademark] and others), the Company sells selected assortments of its products to retailing chains in various trading areas at different times throughout the year, and generally furnishes promotional advertising and display materials, sometimes including related newspaper circulars and inserts for advertising the merchandise. While newspaper circulars were a major part of the Company's programs in the past, this activity has been decreasing for the last several years, to the point where it has been utilized in only a small part of the Company's business in recent years. The Company sells these assortments of merchandise to its customers at fixed percentage discounts from the retail prices at which the merchandise is advertised for sale to the consumer, resulting in uniform overall profitability to the Company's customers. The overall profitability to the Company of the promotional programs depends upon the aggregate costs of the various items included in the assortments. Items have been added to or discontinued in the assortments from time to time, based upon customer demand, retail sell-through and overall profitability to the Company. Promotional programs have been the principal marketing vehicle for the Company's products. Promotional programs, which enhance sales volume and store traffic as compared to the results which might be attained independent of such programs, are the Company's primary area of expertise. The Company believes all of the items in its merchandise line are marketable independent of its promotional programs. The Company's Gift program business has been seasonal to the Christmas selling season. In recent years including fiscal 1996, approximately 50% to 70% of the Company's annual Gift volume has been sold in the Company's second quarter (October, November and December). As a result, commitments to purchase Gift inventories have been made early, in advance of the selling season, and inventory levels have been more difficult to adjust as sales volume has fluctuated. In addition, as the mix of its customer base has changed in recent years to major drug store and grocery store chains, the demand for guaranteed sales has increased. In 1993 and 1994 approximately 50% of the Gift program was sold under guaranteed sales terms. Significant execution problems and excessive returns in 1993 resulted in planned reduction of the business in 1994. While the problems of 1993 were overcome in 1994, the Gift program still did not meet the Company's expectations and, as a result, the Company offered a significantly reduced Gift program principally on a non-guaranteed basis in fiscal 1995 and 1996. PRODUCTS The products sold by the Company consist of imported products, Company-manufactured products, and products purchased from other United States manufacturers and suppliers. The breakdown of consolidated net sales by source is as follows: Imported Products Imported products consist of approximately 600 to 800 items. Most of these items have been manufactured and packaged to the Company's specifications under the Company's brand names. Imported products have been purchased from various manufacturers in twenty countries, primarily in the Far East and Europe. The Company's importing activities have been subject to the effects of inflation and fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies, as well as various other economic and political risks. It has been the Company's practice to purchase in U.S. dollars wherever possible, and to evaluate these risks, as well as the cost and availability of merchandise from all of its product sources, and to change suppliers and countries of origin as necessary to meet its purchasing objectives. While the Company considers its recent sources of supply adequate for its operations and has generally been successful at developing alternative sources of supply, there have not been assurances that suitable merchandise from foreign countries would continue to be available at satisfactory U.S. dollar prices. Company-manufactured Plastics Until August of 1995 the Company manufactured in its own plant (located at its headquarters facility) more than 100 plastic housewares items, such as wastebaskets, laundry baskets, pails, food storage containers, tumblers, storage bins, and the like. As a result of declining sales volume and a decreasing proportionate use of plastics in its existing business, the Company closed its manufacturing facility, and made arrangements to meet its needs for plastic products through outside purchases from both domestic and import sources. Products Purchased from Other United States Manufacturers and Suppliers Domestically manufactured products purchased from others currently have consisted of approximately 100 items sold in the Company's promotional programs. As with its imported products, while the Company considers its recent sources of supply adequate for its operations, there have not been assurances that suitable merchandise from domestic manufacturers would continue to be available to the Company at satisfactory prices. COMPETITION The business of importing and marketing the categories of merchandise sold by the Company is highly competitive. While the Company has experienced some competition from certain importers in terms of "direct import" promotional programs, no competitor has been known to provide the breadth of program selection and services which the Company has provided. The Company however, has experienced competition from a large number of firms, many of which have greater financial resources, including large manufacturers selling branded promotional items, the retailers' own internally developed promotional programs, wholesalers and importers. The Company's promotional programs, including Replenishment, which in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996 accounted for approximately 99.7% of net sales, have been the Company's principal method of competing with other suppliers of like merchandise to retail chains. The Company has endeavored to provide a broad range of value- oriented products and programs, as well as merchandising, point-of-sale displays and other promotional support materials and services, in a unique fashion, responsive to the retailers' needs. The success of the promotional programs has been dependent on achievement of the goal of increasing sales and enhancing gross margin contribution in the stores of the Company's customers. The Company believes it has been the leading independent marketer of promotional programs to the retail trade. The Company's principal competition in providing these programs often has come from its own customers, most of whom have the capabilities to conduct promotional programs internally. Building in-store sales and traffic and providing the retailer with comprehensive, turnkey programs (including promotional merchandise with consistent, reasonable profit margins for the retailer) have been the Company's basis for competition with the internally created promotions of its customers. SEASONALITY Fluctuations in sales of the Company's DOLLAR-AMA [registered trademark and similar promotions from quarter to quarter reflect the cumulative result of individual decisions made by various customers with regard to the timing and placement of orders. Sales of the Company's Gift programs have been seasonally highest in the Company's second fiscal quarter. The December quarter has accounted for approximately 50% to 70% of the annual volume for Gift sales during the last three fiscal years. TRADEMARKS HELD, AND LICENSES AND FRANCHISES GRANTED The Company's trademarks - DOLLAR-AMA [registered trademark], DOLLAR POWER [registered trademark] and others - are recognized by consumers throughout the United States, and represent the basic concepts under which the Company's promotional programs have been sold. Trademarks are considered to be an integral part of the ability to market promotional programs. Trademark rights endure as long as they are in continued use in the conduct of the business. All of the Company's trademarks are to be sold in conjunction with the sale of assets of its Replenishment and Promotional businesses. In connection with the Company's promotional program sales, licenses to use DOLLAR-AMA [registered trademark] and other trademarks have been granted to customers' stores. The licenses have been granted at no additional cost to the customer (the Company charges only for the merchandise provided) for limited periods of time, usually one to two weeks, during which the licensed stores advertise their sales of the Company's merchandise. EMPLOYEES At October 15, 1996 the Company employed 40 regular employees and no temporary employees. At October 15, 1995 it employed 169 regular (including 70 represented by a labor union) and 25 temporary employees. The decrease is due to the downsizing and outsourcing of distribution operations and other work force reductions related to these and other downsizing activities during the year. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES ______________________________________________________________________ The Company occupies the following facilities: Headquarters. The Company's corporate headquarters are located in a 580,000-square foot building on a 43-acre tract of land in Harmar Township, Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh). The facility is leased from Allegheny Capital Growth Limited Partnership. During the third quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company moved all of its inventory and distribution activities from this location to lower cost public warehouse facilities described below. A substantial part of the facility is subleased to a third party under a short-term arrangement. In October 1996 the Company finalized the negotiation of and signed a new lease wherein the Company will lease only 58,000 square feet of office space in the facility. Other Distribution Facilities. The Company has occupied 330,000 square feet at a public warehouse facility in Mt. Vernon Ohio , and 55,000 square feet at an additional distribution facility in Columbus, Ohio. The facilities are occupied under short-term lease arrangements permitting the Company to expand or contract its space to accommodate the Company's fluctuating inventory and distribution volume. The obligations under these leases are expected to be terminated in conjunction with the sale of the inventory. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ______________________________________________________________________ The Company previously reported an adversary action against the Company and some 50 other defendants, filed on August 16, 1994 by the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Phar-Mor, Inc. in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Ohio, and subsequently transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The Official Committee sought the recovery of approximately $75 million (about $2.6 million in the case of Action Industries) paid to the defendants for Phar-Mor shares tendered by them in a July 1991 tender offer. The claim was based upon allegations that at the time of the tender offer Phar-Mor was insolvent or had unreasonably small capital, and, therefore, the transfers pursuant to the tender offer constituted fraudulent conveyances. On August 22, 1995, summary judgment was entered in favor of the Company and the other defendants. In September 1995, the Official Committee filed an appeal of this decision. In October 1996 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court in favor of the Company and the other defendants. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS ______________________________________________________________________ There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996. EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT ______________________________________________________________________ The names, ages, positions and business experience of the Company's executive officers are set forth below. Kenneth L. Campbell, 49. Mr. Campbell has served as Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer since 1989. He has been an executive officer of the Company since his employment in 1984. T. Ronald Casper, 52. Mr. Casper was appointed as Acting President and Chief Executive Officer on September 7, 1995. Since 1988, he has been Managing Director of Cornerstone Capital Advisors, Ltd., a merchant banking organization, of which he is a co-founding principal. Mr. Casper serves under a contract between the Company and Cornerstone, and is not an employee of the Company. He was a consultant to the Company, reviewing its strategic plans, for about two months prior to his appointment. PART II _______________________________________________________________________ ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS _______________________________________________________________________ The Company's common stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange (trading symbol ACZ). The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of the stock during each quarter of the last two fiscal years: There are approximately 1,300 holders of record of the Company's common stock, including brokers named on listings provided by clearing agencies. It is estimated that these holders represent approximately 2,700 beneficial owners of the Company's stock. The Company's Board of Directors has not declared cash dividends during the last two fiscal years and has no present plans to do so. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ______________________________________________________________________ OVERVIEW NOTE: References to a fiscal year in this Form 10-K are to the Company's fiscal year ended on the last Saturday of June prior to 1996, and for fiscal year 1996, ending June 30, 1996. This Item 7 should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Financial Statements and Item 1. FINANCIAL CONDITION The Company has experienced declining sales in its traditional promotional business in recent years. In fiscal 1996 the decline in sales continued, principally due to decreased sales to two of the Company's largest customers of fiscal 1995 (a $6.1 million decrease from $8.8 million in sales last year to $2.7 million in sales in the current year). Sales to three other customers decreased $1.8 million as a result of those customers discontinuing business. In addition, approximately $1.5 million in sales to customers in Mexico and Canada last year were not repeated in the current year as a result of the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. Replenishment (Powerhouse) sales decreased $2.8 million related to new store setup business last year which was not repeated or replaced in the current year, and reduced order fill rates related to the Company's significant reduction in inventory levels in the current year. In general, the Company's reduced inventory levels and capital constraints limited inventory purchasing and resulted in reduced order fill rates and the inability to introduce new programs. Further, the Company closed its retail store in September 1995, which accounted for $600,000 in decreased sales. The Company experienced lost sales opportunities in both fiscal 1996 and 1995 as a result of its efforts to reduce low margin and guaranteed sale business from the level of such business experienced in 1993 and 1994. The historical decline in sales is the result of many factors, including a changing retail marketplace, the increasing complexity of the promotional business itself, and strategic decisions to exit or downsize unprofitable, higher risk product lines. Many of the reasons for the continuation in the decline in sales in fiscal 1996 are symptomatic of the inability of the Company to maintain its past market position. These issues have led to management's decision to sell the inventory and other assets of its Replenishment business and, subject to shareholder approval, the inventory and other assets of its Promotional business. The proceeds of the sales will be used to pay existing obligations and, if an appropriate opportunity presents itself, to explore its other strategic options, including possible business combinations with other operating businesses. Substantial doubt exists as to the ability of the Company to continue to exist as a going concern, unless a business combination can be accomplished which provides additional capital. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The major sources of cash during the 1996 fiscal year were significantly reduced inventory levels (78% reduction) and collections on receivables. Operating losses and repayment of current and long-term obligations were the primary uses of cash. Working capital at June 30, 1996 was $436,000, decreased from $12.8 million at June 24, 1995, largely related to the lower level of sales in the current year and operating and other losses. The Company will be required to continue to manage the timing of payment of its obligations to deal with this impaired liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents were $78,000 at June 30, 1996 as compared to $567,000 at June 24, 1995. Cash balances fluctuate daily to meet operating requirements. Accounts receivable of $2.8 million at June 30, 1996 decreased from $9.9 million at June 24, 1995, as a result of decreased sales, particularly in the month of June, and improved collections in the current year. Inventories of $3.9 million decreased significantly compared to $18.1 million at June 24, 1995, related to the lower level of sales and the Company's aggressive inventory reduction efforts in light of its capital constraints, and inventory adjustments related to the sales of the inventories and writeoffs associated with the termination of the Company's operating business. Aggregate borrowings (long-term debt and notes payable) decreased from $18.0 million at June 24, 1995 to $3.2 million at June 30, 1996. This decrease was primarily the result of elimination of the sale/leaseback obligation as a result of finalizing the negotiations of a new lease, and the repayment of borrowings with cash generated from the reduction of inventories and receivables, net of cash used to fund operating losses incurred. Letters of credit outstanding were $82,000 at June 30, 1996, significantly below $909,000 at June 24, 1995 reflecting reductions in the Company's level of overseas purchases of inventory. The Company's Credit Agreement provides for available credit of up to $10 million through June 30, 1997. Availability under the line is further limited by the level of eligible accounts receivable and inventories. At June 30, 1996 outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $3.0 million and outstanding letters of credit were $82,000. The Company did not meet the required levels of net worth and working capital under the restrictive covenants of the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 1996, and will not be able to meet these covenants subsequently. The lender's remedies under such a default include the right to demand repayment of the outstanding loan. Assuming that the Company's lender will continue to provide credit, given the defaults under the financial covenants, the Company believes that the credit available under its existing borrowing arrangements, together with funds from the sale of its inventories and other operating assets (to which the Company's lender has consented) and from its operations in the period prior to the completion of the sale, will be sufficient to meet most or all of its near term operating needs for the remainder of calendar year 1996. For the longer term, if the Company is to benefit from the use of its tax net operating losses, it must reduce its cost structure to a bare minimum to maintain sufficient liquidity and to provide enough time to identify and close a transaction to acquire a profitable operating business. Unless a business combination and/or a source of additional capital can be achieved in the next few months, there can be no assurance that the Company's capital resources will be sufficient to meet its operating needs, in which case material adverse consequences may result. The Company's capital expenditures were $220,000 in fiscal 1996, all under a project initiated in 1994 to replace its core information systems computer hardware and software. No further capital expenditures are planned. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 1996 Compared with Fiscal 1995 Net Sales. Aggregate net sales for fiscal 1996 were $30,212,000, a decrease of $14,876,000 (33.0%) compared to $45,088,000 in the prior year. The decline in sales in fiscal 1996 was principally due to decreased sales to two of the Company's largest customers of fiscal 1995 (a $6.1 million decrease from $8.8 million in sales last year to $2.7 million in sales in the current year). Sales to three other customers decreased $1.8 million as a result of those customers discontinuing business. In addition, approximately $1.5 million in sales to customers in Mexico and Canada last year were not repeated in the current year as a result of the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. Replenishment (Powerhouse) sales decreased $2.8 million related to new store setup business last year which was not repeated or replaced in the current year, and reduced order fill rates related to the Company's significant reduction in inventory levels in the current year. The closing of the Company's retail store in September 1995 accounted for $600,000 in decreased sales. In general, the Company's reduced inventory levels and capital constraints limited inventory purchasing and resulted in reduced order fill rates and the inability to introduce new programs as planned. Following is a comparison of net sales by type of program: Cost of Products Sold and Gross Profit Margins. Gross profit margins (as a percentage of sales) decreased from 23.8% in fiscal 1995 to 12.7% in the current year, principally due to higher than anticipated returns on prior period guaranteed sales, including increased provisions for returns on guaranteed sales outstanding at June 30, 1996. The Company has also experienced lower gross margins related to its inventory reduction program, as a result of the sale of certain merchandise at reduced prices, and increased (as a percentage of sales) display and other costs due to a decrease in the value of the merchandise included per display fixture. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses decreased from $12,461,000 (27.6% of sales) in fiscal 1995 to $10,462,000 (34.6% of sales) in fiscal 1996. The decrease in costs was the result of the Company's continuing cost reduction efforts. The increase in costs as a percentage of net sales is due to the greater impact of fixed and indirect costs on the lower level of sales, including executive search, legal, and other corporate costs, as well as costs of the Company's merchandise acquisition operation normally allocated to purchases which were not fully absorbed in fiscal 1996 due to the limited purchasing during the year. Interest Expense. The increase of $146,000 was due to higher effective interest rates and other borrowing costs. Average borrowing levels in the current year were also higher as compared to average borrowings attributed to continuing operations last year, resulting from increased borrowings in the first half of the current year. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other expense of $58,000 in fiscal 1996 represented miscellaneous items. The other income amount of $674,000 in fiscal 1995 included a gain on the sale of property in Mt. Clemens, Michigan (site of a previously discontinued operation) in the amount of $950,000 and gains from the sale of plastic production equipment of $296,000, net of the writedown of the estimated value of remaining amounts due from the prior sale of Action Nicholson Color Company of $518,000 and other miscellaneous items. Costs and Expenses Due to Sale of Assets and Closing of Warehouse. As a result of the sale of its operating assets and the resultant termination of its operating business, the Company has taken charges in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996 for the estimated loss on the sale of its inventories and intellectual property ($600,000), other adjustments to reflect the net realizable value of inventory ($2.1 million)and other assets and liabilities($1.4 million). Loss From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. The loss increased from $2,907,000 in fiscal 1995 to $12,899,000 in fiscal 1996. The increase of $9,992,000 reflects the combined effect of all the above. Provision for Income Taxes. No income tax benefits were provided on the losses in fiscal 1996 and 1995 because realization of such benefits cannot be reasonably assured. Net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce future income taxes payable in fiscal 1996 and beyond are approximately $34 million for income tax reporting purposes. Loss From Continuing Operations. The increase of $9,992,000 reflects the combined effect of all of the above. Loss From Discontinued Operation. In fiscal 1995 the Company adopted a plan to sell its lamp business, and completed the sale in September of 1995. Operating losses of $808,000 for fiscal 1995 were reclassified as discontinued. Net Loss. The increased loss of $9,184,000 reflects the combined effect of all the above. Fiscal 1995 Compared with Fiscal 1994 Net Sales. Aggregate net sales for fiscal 1995 were $45,088,000, a decrease of $14,961,000 (24.9%) compared to $60,049,000 in fiscal 1994. Sales to the Company's largest customer in 1994 decreased $9.5 million in fiscal 1995 as a result of that customer's decision to use the Company's programs in a limited manner in 1995. In addition, Gift program sales decreased $6.4 million as a result of the Company's decision to reduce the offering of this program in order to reduce guaranteed sales. The Company's sales volume has declined materially in each of the last several years. It is the Company's belief that economic conditions and other changes in the retail marketplace, along with increased ability on the part of the Company's customers to create their own promotional programs and a shifting customer base, have contributed to the decline in sales volume. Following is a comparison of net sales by type of program: Cost of Products Sold and Gross Profit Margins. Gross profit margins (as a percentage of sales) decreased from 25.8% in fiscal 1994 to 23.8% in fiscal 1995, principally due to increased cost of merchandise sold in core business programs, related primarily to the mix of programs sold and increased plastic manufacturing costs related to the lower level of production in 1995. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses decreased from $13,245,000 (22.1% of sales) in fiscal 1994 to $12,461,000 (27.6% of sales) in fiscal 1995. The increase in costs as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased selling and merchandising costs related to the development of programs for the future, and the lower level of sales in 1995. Interest Expense. The decrease of $238,000 was due to lower average borrowing levels in fiscal 1995 net of increased interest rates and other borrowing costs. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income of $674,000 in fiscal 1995 included a gain on the sale of property in Mt. Clemens Michigan (site of a previously discontinued operation) in the amount of $950,000 and gains from the sale of plastic production equipment of $296,000, net of the writedown of the estimated value of remaining amounts due from the prior sale of Action Nicholson Color Company of $518,000 and other miscellaneous items. The fiscal 1994 income amount of $77,000 was comprised of miscellaneous items. Earnings (Loss) From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. Earnings (Loss) decreased from earnings of $128,000 in fiscal 1994 to a loss of $2,907,000 in fiscal 1995. The decrease of $3,035,000 reflects the combined effect of all the above. Provision for Income Taxes. No income tax benefits were provided on the loss in fiscal year 1995 because realization of such benefits cannot be reasonably assured. No income tax expense was provided on earnings in fiscal year 1994, because previously unrecognized deferred income tax benefits and net operating loss deductions from prior years were available to offset income taxes on current earnings. Earnings (Loss) From Continuing Operations. The decrease of $3,035,000 reflects the combined effect of all the above. Loss From Discontinued Operation. In fiscal 1995 the Company adopted a plan to sell its lamp business, and completed the sale in September of 1995. Operating losses of $808,000 for 1995 and $3,000 for 1994 were reclassified. Net Earnings (Loss). The decrease of $3,840,000 reflects the combined effect of all the above. ITEM 8.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION The members of the compensation committee during fiscal year 1996 were Messrs. Gold, Knowles, Shapira, and until his resignation, Kirsch. Mr Kirsch, who was a nonvoting member, was President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company until his resignation in September 1995. Mr. Shapira is a Director and executive officer of Giant Eagle, Inc. which engaged in several arms-length business transactions with the Company during the fiscal year. The Company sold merchandise to Giant Eagle in the amount of $143,200 and paid Giant Eagle $1,000 in trade show booth fees. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION It is the policy of the compensation committee to compensate executive officers of the Company under a pay plan with three components: base salary, performance-based pay and equity ownership. The compensation plan was developed in 1990 with the assistance and recommendations of compensation consultants. Under this pay system, base salaries for executives are set at or just below the market median for each position, as determined from market survey information for companies with comparable sales volume. Performance-based compensation is paid pursuant to a plan implemented in September 1990. The plan provides that a portion of the compensation payable to each executive officer will be based upon the individual's achievement of predetermined performance objectives and the Company's attainment of overall performance objectives. The plan is a flexible program in which performance objectives, which are individually determined for each executive appropriate to his position, are established each year by senior management. The aggregate amount potentially payable to executives is determined by the Board of Directors each year, based upon a percentage of the Company's profits. The plan has been suspended for the last three fiscal years, as management did not expect the Company to have the financial resources to fund it. The equity ownership portion of executive officer compensation is paid in the form of stock options under a Stock Option Plan approved by the shareholders and amended in 1995. Under this plan the Company earlier granted options to executive officers and other managers for approximately 820,000 shares. The number of option shares granted to each individual is based upon the executive's position in the Company and the relative potential for that position to affect the Company's performance. The option price for each grant is the fair market value at the date of grant. Executives have ten years from the date of grant to exercise their options by paying the option price for the stock. There were no stock option grants under the plan in fiscal 1996 as a result of the Company's performance. The compensation committee believes that this three-component pay system for executive officers effectively balances the employee's need for income security and the Company's need to maximize performance. The base salary component provides the executive a reliable but moderate income stream. The opportunity for any additional income exists only through the performance- based compensation plan and the stock option plan, and is available only by virtue of individual achievement and overall Company performance.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Action Industries, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Action Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1996 and June 24, 1995, and the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1996, as listed in the accompanying index to financial statements Item 14(a). Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at 14(a). These financial statements and the schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Action Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries at June 30, 1996 and June 24, 1995, and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. As more fully described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into an agreement to sell all its inventory and related intellectual property subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders. Additionally, as described in Note D, the Company has experienced recurring losses and is currently in violation of its debt agreement with its lender. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding these matters are also described in Note A. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of the assets or the amounts and classification of the liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. ERNST & YOUNG LLP October 14, 1996 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACTION INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ___________________________________________________________________ NOTE A -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Fiscal Year: References to a fiscal year in these financial statements are to the Company's fiscal year ending for the three most recent fiscal years on June 30, 1996, June 24, 1995 and June 25, 1994. Basis of Presentation: In October 1996 the Company entered into an agreement to sell its inventory and related intellectual property associated with its Replenishment (Powerhouse) business and Promotional business. The Powerhouse-related assets are to be sold promptly. Powerhouse inventories were approximately $570,000 at the date the agreement was signed. The Company's Promotional-related assets have been sold subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders. The assets to be sold represent substantially all of the operating assets currently employed in the Company's business. Trade accounts receivable are to be retained, as well as non-operating notes and other receivables from prior sales of the Company's headquarters facility and certain business units. Upon completion of the sales described above, all of the Company's current operations will have been sold. Also in October 1996 the Company finalized negotiations and signed a new lease arrangement for its headquarters facility. The new lease obligates the Company for rent of approximately $100,000 per year for a five year period under an operating lease. This lease agreement, in conjunction with the physical departure from the warehouse space in the facility, results in the elimination of the previously reported capital lease obligation for the facility. The accompanying financial statements include the historical results of operations of the Company's Promotional and Replenishment businesses. Valuation adjustments have been made to the historical cost basis of the Company's inventories, property and equipment and any other assets impacted by the sale of the Company's current operations, to value these assets at estimated net realizable value and to reflect the abandonment or sale of certain fixed assets no longer used to support operations. The valuation of the assets and liabilities are based on management estimates and assumptions as of the date of issuance of the financial statements. Actual realization of the assets and settlement of the liabilities could be higher or lower than the estimated amounts. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Action Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Until September of 1995, the Company operated a lamp business as Kensington Lamp Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary (KLC). The business and certain assets of KLC were sold in September of 1995, a fiscal 1995 event for financial reporting purposes. The lamp business has been reported as a discontinued operation. Action Nicholson Color Company (ANC), a wholly-owned subsidiary, was sold in April of 1994. ANC was held for sale as of June 26, 1993, and has been reported as a discontinued operation. Financial Instruments: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, and accounts and notes payable are carried at cost, which approximated their fair value at June 30, 1996 and June 24, 1995. Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market. Market valuation is based on known or estimated sales value. Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost. Elimination of the capitalized lease on the Company's headquarters facility and the sale of the Company's operations have resulted in the sale or devaluation of substantially all of the Company's property, plant and equipment as of June 30, 1996. The remaining book value is comprised of computer equipment and office furniture and fixtures in continuing use. Historically, the Company has provided for depreciation (including amortization of assets held under capital leases) over the estimated useful lives or lease terms of the assets, principally on the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives used in providing for depreciation have been 20-40 years for buildings and 3-15 years for machinery and equipment. Property, plant and equipment is comprised of the following (in thousands): Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income tax expense and liabilities under the liability method. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting, relating principally to restructuring charges, reserves for losses on investments and other assets, depreciation and deferred compensation. Employees' Retirement Plans: The Company has defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all of its employees. The plans provide for defined contributions based on eligible employees' compensation. It is the policy to fund retirement plan costs accrued. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise at the time of shipment to its customers. In the case of sales where the customer has the right to return unsold goods (guaranteed sales), revenue recognized is reduced for estimated returns, based on historical experience. Interest Allocation: The Company has allocated interest to discontinued operations based on the receivables and inventories used in such operations. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards: The Company has not adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" (SFAS No. 121). Management does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 121 will have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. The ultimate recovery of the carrying value of the remaining long- lived assets will depend on the results of the Company's efforts to accomplish a business combination with an operating business. The Company has not adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock- Based Compensation" (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123 establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based compensation plans. This Standard is optional, and the Company is permitted to continue to account for its plans under previous accounting standards. The Company does not expect to adopt the recognition provisions of the new accounting standard, and consequently, the future adoption of SFAS No. 123 will not have an impact on the Company's results of operations. NOTE B -- SALE OF OPERATING ASSETS The purchase price for the sale of the Company's Promotional inventory and related intellectual property will not be determined until after the process of obtaining shareholder approval is completed, which is expected to be in December of 1996. The purchase price will equal 63.3% of the cost of the inventory sold plus a cash payment of $100,000. The proceeds of the sale are estimated at approximately $1 million to $1.5 million, and will be used to repay debt under the Company's credit arrangements and trade payables. The estimated loss on the sale (approximately $600,000) has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements. In addition, the Company has incurred additional inventory losses of approximately $1.8 million related to the sales of all current operations, including excess quantities and other obsolete inventories, primarily display materials; unabsorbed acquisition costs related to the Company's low level of purchasing in 1996 and the writeoff of unamortized display costs. These losses have been recorded as a reduction in the value of inventory in the accompanying financial statements. The Company, with the help of its advisors, is actively exploring other strategic options available to it, including business combinations with other operating businesses in order to continue as an operating concern and preserve all or a portion of its income tax net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has received indications of interest from third parties, and has been engaged in specific discussions relating to such a transaction with interested parties. Such discussions are preliminary and may not result in an agreement relating to any such transaction, and the Company may not be able to maintain sufficient capital to continue the pursuit of such transactions. The issues discussed above and those discussed in Note D regarding the status of the Company's credit facilities raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. NOTE C -- DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Kensington Lamp Company: The Company owns 100% of the common stock of Kensington Lamp Company (KLC), now inactive, but formerly an assembler of lead crystal and other table lamps. The Company sold certain of the assets and the business to KLC management in September of 1995. Terms of the sale included retention of accounts receivable by the Company, assumption of inventory- related accounts payable by the buyer, and an interest bearing note secured by a second mortgage on inventories and receivables, payable over a 42 month period which began November 1, 1995. As of June 30, 1996 the amount receivable under the note was $1,299,900. The estimated  realizable value from the sale was included in other current assets and other long-term assets in the accompanying balance sheet as of June 24, 1995 as if the sale had taken place in the year ended June 24, 1995. The statement of operations for 1994 was restated to reflect KLC as a discontinued operation. Total sales for KLC were $10.1 million for 1995 and $9.3 million for 1994. Interest allocated to KLC in the accompanying statement of operations was $334,000 in fiscal 1995 and $283,000 in fiscal 1994. Action Nicholson Color Company: The Company owns 100% of the common stock of Action Nicholson Color Company (ANC), now inactive, but formerly a producer of color separations. The Company sold the assets and the business of ANC in April of 1994. Terms of the sale included a cash payment at closing and future payments based on sales of the business over the three years subsequent to April 1994. The estimated net realizable value of the future payments ($125,000 as of June 30, 1996) is included in the accompanying balance sheet. NOTE D -- LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES Long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 1996 and June 24, 1995 consisted of $115,000 in 9% Convertible Subordinated Debentures, due in 1998. There are no current maturities of long-term debt. Convertible Subordinated Debentures: The Debentures may be converted into common stock at a price of $9.87 per share at any time prior to maturity. If conversion does not occur, the Company is required to redeem the Debentures on the maturity date, April 1, 1998. The Debentures may be redeemed early, at the Company's option, upon payment of a premium. The sale of substantially all of the Company's operating assets in a transaction requiring shareholder approval may require redemption of the Debentures at the time the sale is completed. Credit Facilities: The Company's Credit Agreement provides for available credit of up to $10 million through June 30, 1997. Availability under the credit line is further limited by the level of eligible accounts receivable and inventories. Interest is payable at 3.5% over the prime rate of interest. Borrowings are used for short-term financing under notes payable and to back up letters of credit issued against purchases of imported merchandise. Borrowings are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets, including its cash balances, accounts receivable, inventories, and property, plant and equipment. Short-term borrowings against the credit lines ranged from a high of $12.4 million to a low of $2.5 million during the 1996 fiscal year. At June 30, 1996 the unused borrowing capacity based on the borrowing formula in the agreement was $1.5 million. During the year ended June 24, 1995, borrowings ranged from a high of $14.6 million to a low of $4.6 million. The Company did not meet the required levels of net worth and working capital under the restrictive covenants of its Credit Agreement as of June 30, 1996, and will not be able to meet these covenants subsequently. The lender's remedies under such a default include the right to demand repayment of the outstanding loan. Maturities of Debt: There are no maturities of long-term debt for the five fiscal years subsequent to 1996, with the exception of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures due April 1, 1998 ($115,000). Interest paid was $2,067,000 during the year ended June 30, 1996, $2,098,000 in 1995, and $2,585,000 in 1994. NOTE E -- SALE/LEASEBACK In 1991 the Company refinanced its headquarters facility under a sale/leaseback arrangement. The facility was sold for $14 million, $3.5 million of which was in the form of an interest bearing note receivable. $10.5 million was received in cash. The transaction was accounted for as a financing, wherein the property remained on the books and continued to be depreciated. A financing obligation representing the proceeds was recorded, and was reduced based on payments under the lease. The sale/leaseback financing obligation was eliminated in October of 1996 when the Company completed negotiations and agreed to an operating lease on the office space in the facility (which space represents approximately 10% of the total space in the facility). In connection with the settlement of the sale/leaseback obligation, the note receivable was reduced to $2.3 million from the original $3.5 million, and the note will not bear interest until 1998. An unrelated third party has leased the entire warehouse portion of the space from the Company's landlord. As a result of the Company's vacating the warehouse facilities during March and April of 1996 and the signing of a new operating lease, the capitalized lease obligation was eliminated from the financial statements as of June 30, 1996. The note receivable has not been recorded in the financial statements because realization of the note continues to be uncertain. Upon sale or refinancing of the property the landlord is obligated to repay the note. Such repayment will be reported as income when received. The original sale/leaseback (under which the Company has been the sole tenant) had a lease term of twelve years for the office and eight years for the warehouse (beginning in April 1991) and required minimum annual rental payments of approximately $1.9 million per year through 1999 and lesser payments thereafter. The new lease requires minimum annual rental payments of $100,000 per year for the five year period beginning November 1, 1996. The Company's office space requirements are currently less than the space rented under the new lease. The Company and its landlord are actively seeking prospective tenants to relieve the Company of some or all of its obligations under the lease. Termination of the original sale/leaseback lease resulted in elimination of the capitalized lease obligation ($6.9 million at June 30, 1996) from the balance sheet, offset by the elimination of the land, building and certain equipment directly related to the facility with an aggregate net book value of approximately $6.2 million. In addition, the Company incurred significant costs associated with vacating the facility, including severance ($200,000), idle facilities rent and utilities (approximately $300,000), and other costs including moving and inventory transfer costs and inventory losses. NOTE F -- INCOME TAXES Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts reported for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred income tax liabilities and assets are as follows:  The reconciliation of the effective income tax rate to the Federal statutory rate is as follows: The Company has net operating loss carryforwards available for income tax reporting purposes of approximately $34 million expiring in 2008 through 2011 which, upon recognition, based on current tax rates, could result in future tax benefits of approximately $13.8 million. The Company made no tax payments during the years ended June 30, 1996, June 24, 1995 and June 25, 1994. NOTE G -- EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT PLANS Contributions under the Company's retirement plans were $75,000 in 1996, $123,000 in 1995 and $133,000 in 1994. Contributions were for employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement, which provides for such contributions at a rate of 6% of eligible compensation. All employees eligible for contributions under the collective bargaining agreement were terminated prior to June 30, 1996. NOTE H -- OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET Other income (expense) consists of the following (in thousands): NOTE I -- LEASES The Company leases office space and equipment under noncancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (including the new facility leases referred to in Note E above are $338,000 in 1997; $287,000 in 1998; $215,000 in 1999; $100,000 in 2000 and $100,000 in 2001. Currently there are no leases with payments due beyond 2001. Rent expense under operating leases (excluding the sale/leaseback transaction which was a capital lease) amounted to $280,000 in 1996, $855,000 in 1995, and $905,000 in 1994. NOTE J -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments as of June 30, 1996 for outstanding letters of credit for merchandise purchases were $82,000. The Company owned property located in Mt. Clemens, Michigan, the book value of which was previously written off. The Company sold the property in June of 1995. Certain necessary environmental cleanup procedures will be completed by the buyer of the property under the terms of the sale. Creditors of Phar-Mor, Inc. previously filed a claim against the Company (and other shareholders and former shareholders of Phar- Mor) to recover certain proceeds (approximately $2.6 million) received by the Company in connection with a Phar-Mor tender offer in fiscal 1992 for part of the Company's investment in the common stock of Phar-Mor. The claim has been denied by summary judgment, with no repayment required of the Company. An appeal of the denial was filed by the Creditors in September 1995. In October of 1996 the summary judgment was affirmed by the appeals court. NOTE K -- SEGMENT INFORMATION AND CREDIT CONCENTRATION The Company has operated in one market segment - sales to retailers. Substantially all of the Company's accounts receivable are from retailers. The Company's credit arrangements with its customers are generally unsecured. Credit loss experience has been in line with the expectations of management. Substantially all operations have been located in the United States. Export sales were less than 10% of net sales. During fiscal 1996 one entity accounted for 18.2% of the Company's consolidated net sales, as a result of the merger of two customers which accounted for 9.9% and 9.2% respectively. One customer accounted for 11.6% of consolidated net sales in 1995 and one customer accounted for 15.3% of consolidated net sales in 1994. The Company has had several large customers which have been significant to its business. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996 the Company sold in excess of $1 million to each of six customers who, in the aggregate, accounted for 42% of net sales. In the fiscal year ended June 24, 1995 the Company sold in excess of $1 million to each of eleven customers who, in the aggregate accounted for 48% of net sales. The loss of large customers has had an adverse effect on the Company. NOTE L -- STOCK OPTION PLANS The Company has adopted Stock Option Plans which provide for the granting of stock options to certain key employees and directors. The Plans reserve 1,055,300 shares of common stock. Options are granted at no less than fair market value of the shares at the date of grant. Option activity for 1996, 1995 and 1994 was as follows: NOTE M -- UNAUDITED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following table summarizes the reported results of continuing operations for each quarterly period in fiscal 1996 and 1995. The quarterly results for 1995 were restated from the amounts previously reported to reflect the discontinuance of the Company's lamp assembly business. Amounts shown are stated in thousands of dollars, except per share data. The fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996 includes accounting adjustments to reflect the loss on the sale of the Company's inventories and intellectual property ($600,000), inventory adjustments of approximately $2 million related to the sales of all current operations, including excess quantities and other obsolete inventories, primarily display materials; unabsorbed acquisition costs related to the Company's low level of purchasing in 1996 and the writeoff of unamortized display costs. Other assets were written down $400,000.

("Action"), a Pennsylvania corporation and ALLEGHENY CAPITAL GROWTH LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (formerly, Allegheny Industrial Park, L.P.), a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"). Background The parties hereto entered into a sale and leaseback arrangement pursuant to which Action sold to the Partnership and simultaneously leased back from the Partnership certain real property, improvements and personalty located in Harmar Township, Pennsylvania (the "Property") and, in connection therewith, Action lent the Partnership $13,900,000.00 to purchase the Property as evidenced by a Promissory Note in said amount dated June 29, 1990 (the "$13,900,000.00 Note"). Concurrently with delivery of the $13,900,000.00 Note and transfer of the Property, the Partnership leased the Property back to Action pursuant to a Lease (the "Lease Agreement") also dated June 29, 1990. On or about March 26, 1991, the Partnership repaid the $13,900,000.00 Note but a portion of said $13,900,000.00 Note, namely, $3,500,000.00, was repaid with the proceeds of a loan in the amount of $3,500,000.00 made by Action to the Partnership and evidenced by the Partnership's Note (the "Original Note") to Action in the amount of $3,500,000.00 dated March 26, 1991. Action agreed to make the $3,500,000.00 loan evidenced by the Original Note pursuant to a Loan Agreement dated February 1991 (the "Existing Loan Agreement"), which superseded two prior loan agreements relating to the same general subject, one dated August 14, 1990 (the "First Loan Agreement") and one dated January 31, 1991 (the "Second Loan Agreement"). The Lease Agreement was amended in connection with the First Loan Agreement, all pursuant to a First Amendment to Lease Agreement dated August 14, 1990 (the "First Lease Amendment"). The Lease Agreement was further amended in connection with the Second Loan Agreement by a Second Amendment to Lease dated January 31, 1991 (the "Second Lease Amendment") and was still further amended in connection with the Existing Loan Agreement, all pursuant to a Restated Second Amendment to Lease Agreement dated February 4, 1991 (the "Restated Second Amendment") (the Lease Agreement as amended by the First Lease Amendment, the Second Lease Amendment and the Restated Second Amendment is hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Current Lease"). The Original Note had a stated maturity date of March 26, 1995. The Partnership has alleged that the maturity date of the Original Note was extended and did not pay off the principal outstanding as of March 26, 1995. Action disputes that the maturity date of the Original Note was ever extended. Action has alleged the amount of rent due under the Current Lease was modified after March 26, 1995 and also has claimed a right to offset all or a portion of the remaining rent due under the Current Lease against amounts due under the Original Note. The Partnership has alleged that the rent provisions of the Current Lease were not modified and has claimed that Action is in default of the Current Lease by virtue of its failure to pay the full rent due under the Current Lease and has alleged that Action has no right to offset said unpaid portions of the rent against the Original Note. Action currently subleases a portion of the Warehouse Space (as defined in the Current Lease) to Executive Warehouse, Inc. ("EWI") pursuant to a sublease dated February 19, 1996 (the "EWI Sublease"). EWI and the Partnership intend to execute a new lease for the entire Warehouse Space (the "EWI Lease"). The date on which the EWI Lease becomes effective is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Date". To resolve their differences, the parties have agreed, among other things, to (a) amend and restate the Current Lease by executing and delivering an Amended and Restated Lease Agreement in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "New Lease") and (b) cancel the Original Note, and terminate the obligations of the parties under the Existing Loan Agreement, upon delivery to Action of an executed Promissory Judgment Note in the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "New Note") and an executed Supplemental Promissory Judgment Note in the form of Exhibit C hereto (the "Supplemental Note"). This Agreement, the New Lease, the New Note and the Supplemental Note (together with such other agreements, documents and instruments, if any, as may be contemplated hereby or thereby, the "Transaction Documents") are inter-related and are given to resolve differences relating to the Current Lease and the Original Lease and arise out of the same transaction. Terms NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. Execution and Delivery of Transaction Documents. Concurrently with its execution and delivery hereof (a) Action will execute and deliver to the Partnership the New Lease and will deliver to its counsel, in escrow, the Original Note and (b) the Partnership will execute and deliver to Action the New Lease, the New Note and the Supplemental Note. The New Lease, the New Note and the Supplemental Note will become effective by their own terms on the Effective Date without further action by the parties. Upon the occurrence of the Effective Date, Action's counsel shall deliver to the Partnership the Original Note marked "Canceled." 2. Effect of Transaction Documents Becoming Effective. Upon the Effective Date, the Current Lease, the Original Note and the Existing Loan Agreement shall all be deemed to have been terminated (and, in the case of the Original Note, canceled, irrespective of whether it has been delivered to the Partnership) and neither party shall have any further liability thereunder, except for, in the case of Action, obligations and liabilities arising or accruing under the Current Lease on or before the Effective Date or which survive the expiration of the Current Lease (other than liabilities consisting of, or arising out of, Action's failure to pay Annual Office Rent or Annual Warehouse Rent thereunder in an aggregate amount of more than $97,000 per month). 3.

The Partnership will use its reasonable efforts to obtain necessary waivers from Metropolitan and EWI. 5. Action Offset Rights. From and after the Effective Date and so long as either the New Note or the Supplemental Note remains outstanding, Action shall be entitled to offset against its obligations to pay Annual Rent under and as defined in the New Lease amounts owed to Action by the Partnership under the New Note or the Supplemental Note which are in default beyond any applicable cure period, first against amounts in default under the Supplemental Note, then against amounts in default under the New Note, subject to the following restrictions: (a) such right of offset may not be exercised to the extent that an offset would, after taking into account monthly base rent actually paid under the EWI Lease, the New Lease and any other lease then in effect with respect to the Property, reduce the aggregate monthly rental payments made to the Partnership under such leases to an amount which would be less than the amount then due to the holder of the first motgage lien on the Property; provided, that the Partnership shall pay all amounts so received in respect of base rent to such first mortgage holder; and (b) it is expressly understood and agreed that such right of offset is subordinate to the rights of such first mortgage holder and to the rights of EWI under the EWI Lease and, if either of them or their designees shall obtain title to the Property, it shall not be enforceable against either of them. 6. Partnership Offset Rights. From and after the effective date of the New Lease, the Partnership shall be entitled to offset against its obligations to pay amounts due under the New Note amounts owed by Action under the New Lease which are in default beyond any applicable cure period. If the New Lease is disaffirmed, avoided or rejected in any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding (collectively, a "Rejection"), the amount which the Partnership shall be entitled to offset under the New Note for periods after the date of Rejection shall be equal to (a) the Annual Rent due under the New Lease for the remainder of the originally stated term thereof, irrespective of such Rejection, plus (b) the amount which Action would have been required to pay in respect of Impositions (defined below) during the remainder of the originally stated term thereof, irrespective of such Rejection, minus (c) any rent and amounts paid in respect of Impositions by any tenants who lease any of the space covered by the New Lease during the remainder of the originally stated term thereof, net of all expenses incurred by the Partnership in reletting such space. As used herein, "Impositions" shall mean all CAM Charges, Outside Common Area Expenses, real estate taxes and assessments and insurance on the Building and the Land (as all of such terms are defined in the New Lease). The amount owed by Action in respect of Impositions which have not been determined as of the date of Rejection shall be equal to the amount of Impositions for which Action was liable during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of Rejection multiplied by the number of years remaining in the term of the New Lease, with partial years being pro rated accordingly. The parties acknowledge and agree that the rights of the Partnership under this Section shall not be affected or impaired by any Rejection. 7. Material Inducement. The parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 are material inducements to each party entering into the Transaction Documents. 8. Additional Agreements. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Current Lease, the parties agree that Action shall not be in default for non-payment of Annual Rent thereunder if it pays Annual Rent at the rate of $97,000 per month through the Effective Date (if the Effective Date occurs) or such earlier date as this Agreement is terminated pursuant to subsection (d) below. After giving effect to the previous sentence (and subject to subsection (d) below if the Effective Date does not occur), the Partnership agrees that Action has paid Annual Rent through September 30, 1996. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, Action remains responsible for the payment and performance of all of its obligations under the Current Lease until the same is terminated or expires. (b) Amounts paid by Action under the Current Lease in respect of Annual Rent and additional rent for periods after the Effective Date shall be pro rated as of the Effective Date. (c) The parties shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Effective Date to occur. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Action shall comply with its maintenance, repair and replacement obligations under the Current Lease at all times prior to the Effective Date. (d) If the Effective Date does not occur on or before December 31, 1996, then either party shall have the right, at any time thereafter but prior to the Effective Date by giving written notice to the other to such effect, to terminate this Agreement; provided, that if the Effective Date does not occur by such date due to the act or omission of either party, then such party shall have no right to give such notice. In addition, if the Partnership terminates the Current Lease as permitted thereunder prior to the Effective Date, then the Partnership shall have the right to teminate this Agreement. If this Agreement is so terminated then the Original Note, the Existing Loan Agreement and the Current Lease shall remain in full force and effect and the parties shall have their rights and obligations thereunder as if this Agreement had never existed; provided, that the obligation of (i) the Partnership to pay interest on the Original Note and (ii) Action to pay Annual Rent and additional rent under the Current Lease shall be deemed to have been satisfied in full through June 1, 1996. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the New Note, if required by the holder of the first mortgage lien on the Property or by EWI, Action will extend the term of the New Note, including without limitation the date set forth in Paragraph 3(a) of the New Note, but in no event beyond the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. (f) From time to time upon the written request of Action, the Partnership shall confirm in writing that none of the following events or conditions has occurred from and after the date of this Agreemant or, if any such an event has occurred, shall give to Action a written description of such event: (i) the incurrence by the Partnership of any obligation for borrowed money owed to a bank or other financial institution ("Indebtedness") or any refinancing of any Indebtedness; (ii) a default in respect of any Indebtedness or an event which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time, will constitute such a default, but only if the Partnership has received notice of such default or event from its lender; (iii) the acceleration of any Indebtedness or the commencement by the holder of any Indebtedness of any action or proceeding to enforce its remedies in respect thereof; or (iv) any transfer of the Property or the Partnership or any interest therein. ANY REQUEST MADE BY ACTION UNDER THIS SUBSECTION SHALL REFERENCE THIS SUBSECTION AND THE FACT THAT THE FAILURE OF THE PARTNERSHIP TO RESPOND TO SUCH REQUEST CONSTITUTES A DEFAULT UNDER THE NEW NOTE AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL NOTE. 9. Nature and Survival of Representations. The representations and warranties of the Partnership and Action contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall be deemed to constitute representations and warranties of the respective party delivering the same and shall survive the Effective Date until the New Note shall have been paid in full. 10. Voluntary Agreement. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT IS REPRESENTED BY LEGAL COUNSEL OF ITS CHOICE AND THAT IT HAS CONSULTED WITH ITS COUNSEL REGARDING THIS AGREEMENT, THAT IT IS FULLY AWARE OF THE TERMS CONTAINED HEREIN AND THAT IT HAS VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT COERCION OR DURESS OF ANY KIND ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT. 11.

C. Landlord and Tenant now desire to amend and restate the Existing Lease effective as of the Effective Date (as said term is defined in Article 6 hereof) in the manner hereinafter set forth. ARTICLE 1 - AGREEMENT TO LEASE In consideration of the covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound, subject to Article 7 hereof, Landlord (a) leases to Tenant and Tenant leases from Landlord the Offices and (b) grants to Tenant (i) the exclusive right to use the driveways and walkways located in the area (the "Action Outside Area") shown on the Site Plan as the Action Outside Area for roadway and walkway purposes subject to the rights reserved to Landlord in Section 2.4 and Article 7 hereof and (ii) the non- exclusive right to use in common with others entitled thereto the driveways and walkways located in the area (the "Common Outside Area") shown on the Site Plan as the Common Outside Area, for roadway and walkway purposes, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and further subject to all encumbrances and other matters of record existing as of the original date of the Existing Lease or incurred since such date due to the act or omission of, or with the consent of, Tenant. In no event shall use of the driveways and walkways located in the Action Outside Area by other tenants or subtenants in the Property nor by their employees, contractors, agents or invitees constitute a breach of the foregoing provisions of this Lease nor shall Landlord have any responsibility or liability to Tenant to assure that other tenants, subtenants or their employees, contractors, agents or invitees do no make use of the Action Outside Area. Tenant may implement reasonable signage and take reasonable steps to prevent other tenants from using the driveways, walkways and parking spaces located in the Action Outside Area, subject, however, to the rights reserved for the benefit of Landlord and other tenants set forth in Section 2.4. ARTICLE 2 - LEASE OF SPACE 2.1 Leased Premises. The Offices leased by Tenant hereunder are marked with hash marks on Floor Plan 1 attached hereto as part of Exhibit C-1. The Offices, the Action Outside Area and the Common Outside Area are accepted in "as-is" condition. The terms "Leased Premises" or "Premises", as used in this Lease, shall mean the Offices. 2.2 Term. The term of this Lease (the "Lease Term") shall commence on the Effective Date (as said term is defined in Article 6 hereof) and shall end at 11:59 p.m. on the date which is one (1) day prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date, unless sooner terminated under the provisions of this Lease. The Effective Date shall also be the commencement date (the "Commencement Date") under this Lease. 2.3 Rent. Beginning on the Commencement Date and continuing throughout the Lease Term, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord annual rent ("Annual Rent") for the Premises in an amount equal to One Hundred Thousand and No/100ths ($100,000.00) Dollars. Annual Rent shall be payable in monthly installments, in advance and without demand, deduction, setoff or counterclaim except as otherwise provided in this Lease, on the first business day of each calendar month throughout the Lease Term. 2.4 Parking. The parking spaces (the "Action Parking Area") located in the Action Outside Area are (until exercise of the Recapture Right under Article 7 hereof) hereby declared to be for the exclusive use of Tenant's employees, guests, invitees and sublessees throughout the Lease Term, subject to any claims, takings, rules, laws or regulations of any governmental agencies or divisions. After exercise of the Recapture Right, the parking spaces in the Action Parking Area shall be governed by Article 7 and the rights of Landlord under Article 7 and, in any event, Tenant's rights in the Parking Spaces, shall, unless Landlord otherwise elects, be non-exclusive and subject to limitation as to the number of paces available to Tenant as provided in Article 7. Landlord may temporarily close all or any portion of the Action Outside Area for the purpose, of making repairs, performing necessary maintenance, constructing improvements or complying with governmental requirements (but nothing contained herein shall be deemed to imply that Landlord has any obligation to repair, maintain, improve or comply with governmental requirements), in which event Landlord shall provide an equivalent number of substitute parking spaces on the Land as close to the Offices as possible for the temporary period during which such repairs, maintenance or construction are being performed or such compliance is required, to the extent such spaces are available. Landlord reserves a right around the perimeter of the Action Parking area for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide vehicular ingress and egress to other portions of the Property for Landlord and for any other tenants on the Property. ARTICLE 3 - ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING 3.1 Tenant Subletting and Assignment. Tenant may sublet all or any part of the Leased Premises in each case only for the Permitted Uses and, in each case, only with the prior written consent of Landlord which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Such sublease shall not grant any greater rights than are available to Tenant under this Lease. Tenant will notify Landlord promptly of any modifications to such subleases and shall not modify any such subleases without the prior written consent of the Landlord which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. As to any such space sublet, Tenant shall remain liable for the performance of all terms and conditions of this Lease which apply to the premises sublet. Tenant may not assign this Lease, by operation of law or otherwise, without the consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. An assignment of this Lease may be only for use of the Premises for the Permitted Uses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 3.2, no assignment or subletting shall relieve Tenant from its obligations hereunder and Tenant shall remain fully and primarily liable therefor. If this Lease be assigned, Landlord may, whether or not it has consented to any such assignment, at any time and from time to time collect rent and other charges from the assignee, subtenant or occupant, and apply the net amount collected to the rent and other charges herein reserved. If the Premises, or any part thereof, is sublet or occupied by anyone other than Tenant, Landlord may, whether or not it has consented to such subletting or occupancy, at any time, and from time to time, after a Default of Tenant has occurred and so long as such Default of Tenant is continuing, collect rent and other charges herein reserved from the subtenant or occupant and apply the net amount collected to the rent and other charges reserved herein. No such assignment, subletting, occupancy or collection shall be deemed a waiver of any breach of this Section 3.1, or the acceptance of the assignee, subtenant or occupant as a tenant or (except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 3.2) a release of Tenant from the further performance by Tenant of its obligations hereunder. The consent by Landlord to an assignment or subletting shall in no way be construed to relieve Tenant or any successor from obtaining the express consent in writing of Landlord to any further assignment or subletting. 3.2 Release of Original Tenant in the Case of Certain Assignments of this Lease . If the original Tenant shall assign this Lease to an assignee (the "Assignee") approved in writing by Landlord in accordance with Section 3.1, such assignment shall not relieve the original Tenant from its obligations under this Lease and the original Tenant shall remain fully and primarily liable therefor notwithstanding such assignment, unless each of the following conditions have been satisfied: (a) The identity and creditworthiness of the Assignee shall have been approved in writing by each of the Landlord, the holder of the first mortgage on the Property, the tenant (the "EWI Tenant") under the EWI Lease (as said term is hereinafter defined) and Glenshaw Glass Company, Inc. ("Glenshaw") which approval may be given or withheld by any of such parties, in their sole and complete discretion; (b) The Assignee shall have assumed all of Tenant's obligations under the Lease under a direct agreement (the "Assumption Agreement") with Landlord and shall agree to observe, perform and comply with the Lease directly to and for the benefit of Landlord, all pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Landlord, the holder of the first mortgage on the Property, the EWI Tenant and Glenshaw; and (c) The original Tenant shall have released Landlord of any and all claims, liabilities and obligations which Landlord may have under or on account of this Lease with respect to matters first arising from and after the effective date of any such assignment of this Lease (and, for this purpose, Tenant agrees that the effective date of such assignment and the effective date of the Assumption Agreement shall be identical), all pursuant to an agreement (the "Tenant's Release") in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Landlord; and (d) Landlord shall have executed and delivered to Tenant a release (the "Landlord's Release") with respect to matters first arising under the Lease from and after the effective date of the Assumption Agreement, all pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord. In no event shall the Landlord's Release release Tenant of any obligations accruing with respect to any matters occurring prior to the effective date of such Landlord's Release; (e) In Tenant's request for approval of any such Landlord's Release, the original Tenant shall specifically request that it be released of obligations under the Lease in accordance with this Section 3.2 and furnishes such financial and other information concerning the Assignee as Landlord, the holder of the first mortgage on the Property, the EWI Tenant and Glenshaw may require in their sole discretion; (f) No Default of Tenant shall have occurred and be continuing under this Lease. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Landlord's Release and the Tenant's Release shall not release any claims which either Landlord or Tenant may have against the other under Sections 4.5 or 4.16 of this Lease with respect to matters which have occurred prior to the effective date of such assignment or Assumption Agreement notwithstanding that a claim for indemnification thereunder may be made subsequent to the giving of any such releases by Landlord and Tenant. All of the provisions of this Section 3.2 are solely for the benefit of the original Tenant, namely, Action Industries, Inc. and shall not be for the benefit of any assignee or sublessee thereof. All reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with its review and approval of any of the matters referred to in this Section 3.2 shall be borne by Tenant, including, without limitation, all reasonable legal fees incurred by Landlord in connection with any of the matters referred to in this Section 3.2. ARTICLE 4 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 4.1 Name of Property. Landlord shall have the right to, at its option, continue to name the Property "Action Industrial Park" or to change the name of the Property to such other name as Landlord may elect, in each case, without any responsibility or liability to Tenant of any kind or nature.

Any installment of Annual Rent not paid by Tenant on or before the Late Payment Date (as said term is hereinafter defined) will be subject to a late penalty of 5% of the amount due. As used herein, the term "Late Payment Date" shall mean the date which is the first to occur of (a) ten (10) days after the date when such rent or other payment is due under this Lease, or (b) a time period which is two (2) days less than the late payment time period applicable to monthly mortgage payments under any first mortgage from time to time encumbering the Property. Upon request by Tenant, from time to time, Landlord shall advise Tenant of the date upon which a late payment penalty would be payable under the first mortgage on the Property. 4.5 Permitted Use. Landlord covenants that, subject to restrictions of record and governmental laws or regulations, Tenant may use the Leased Premises for office space, showroom space and related storage space and other related purposes in connection with the conduct of its existing business and except, further, in no event may the Leased Premises be used as a facility for the storage or manufacture of Hazardous Materials (as said term is hereinafter defined) or for the use of Hazardous Materials. Tenant agrees not to use, permit or suffer the use of the Leased Premises for any other purpose without the consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Tenant shall observe and comply with all applicable governmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations governing Tenant's use of the Property, including but not limited to all laws, regulations and ordinances of local, state or federal agencies pertaining to air and water quality, hazardous materials, waste disposal, air emissions, general environmental record keeping and reporting and zoning. If Tenant breaches the obligations stated herein, which obligations Tenant does not remedy, or if contamination of the Property occurs for which Tenant, or any of Tenant's subtenants, licensees or invitees is legally liable in damages, then Tenant shall indemnify, defend, and hold Landlord and its officers, directors, and employees harmless from, all claims, judgments, damages, penalties, fines, liens, costs, liabilities and losses which arise during or after the Lease Term as a result of such breach or contamination. Tenant shall notify Landlord in the event of material contamination of the Property by Tenant not remedied by Tenant within 90 days or if Tenant receives notice from any governmental authority or private party of any claim, proceeding, litigation, order or directive regarding environmental matters referenced herein. Tenant shall not install underground storage tanks on or under the Property without the consent of Landlord. In the event any electrical transformer installed or caused to be installed by Tenant on the Property contains 50 parts per million or greater of polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs"), Tenant shall be responsible, financially and otherwise, for the proper use and disposal of such transformers in accordance with all applicable local, state or federal regulations governing such transformers. If, after the date hereof, the Property becomes contaminated by Hazardous Materials (as said term is hereinafter defined) for which Landlord is legally liable in damages (exclusive of any contamination or Hazardous Materials for which Tenant or any assignee, sublessee, successor, assign or licensee of Tenant may be responsible), Landlord shall indemnify, defend and hold the original Tenant and its officers, directors and employees harmless from all claims, judgments, damages, penalties, fines, liens, costs, liabilities and losses arising during or after the Term of this Lease. The provisions of the indemnity contained in the preceding sentence shall be for the benefit of the original Tenant only, namely, Action Industries, Inc., and shall not benefit any assignee, transferee or sublessee thereof. Tenant represents and warrants to Landlord that there are no underground storage or other tanks at the Property and that removal of any underground storage or other tanks was completed by Tenant in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. The term "Hazardous Materials" shall include, without limitation, any material or substance which is (i) petroleum, (ii) asbestos, (iii) designated as a "hazardous substance" pursuant to Section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq. (33 U.S.C. Section 1321) or listed pursuant to Section 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1317), (iv) defined as a "hazardous waste" pursuant to Section 1004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq. (42 U.S.C. Section 6903), (v) defined as a "hazardous substance" pursuant to Section 101 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq. (42 U.S.C. Section 9601), as amended, (vi) defined as "oil" or a "hazardous waste", a "hazardous substance", a "hazardous material" or a "toxic material" under any other law, rule or regulation applicable to the Property or (vii) is biologically or chemically active. 4.6 Tenant's Pro Rata Share. Except as otherwise provided herein, Tenant's Pro Rata Share, as used in this Lease, shall be an amount calculated by multiplying the amount of the costs, expenses or charges being prorated by a fraction whose numerator is the total number of square feet of floor area leased by Tenant in the Leased Premises and whose denominator is the total number of square feet of leasable floor area in the Offices and the Warehouse and any other building now or hereafter constructed on the Land, except that for purposes of calculating Tenant's share of Common Outside Area Expenses (as opposed to CAM Charges), Tenant's Pro Rata Share shall be 25%. The total number of leasable square feet of floor area in the Offices and the Warehouse on the Commencement Date is 580,140 square feet. Based on the foregoing, Tenant's Pro Rata Share shall be 9.98%. Any change in floor area resulting from construction by Landlord of an addition to or expansion or reduction of the Leased Premises or the Warehouse will be included in the calculation of floor area for purposes of this Section and, in such case, Tenant's Pro Rata Share (both the 9.98% and the 25%) will be adjusted accordingly. The architect in charge of the construction of such addition, expansion or reduction shall certify to Landlord and Tenant the square footage of the addition, expansion or reduction by measuring from the exterior faces of exterior walls or, if none, to the center of any demising partition, without deduction for columns or structural elements. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section, for purposes of more fairly allocating costs among tenants, in calculating Tenant's Pro Rata Share, any CAM Charges or Common Outside Area Expenses which can be reasonably attributed only to the Leased Premises or the Warehouse, or to a particular portion thereof, shall be allocated in the reasonable discretion of Landlord to the tenant or tenants in that portion of the Buildings. 4.7 Tenant's Care of Leased Premises, CAM Charges, Common Outside Area Expenses. (a) Tenant shall, at its own cost and expense, keep the Leased Premises (and all electrical, heating, air conditioning, ventilating, plumbing, drains and other utility systems which exclusively serve the Leased Premises as well as the roof of the Leased Premises) in good, clean operating order, condition and repair, except for ordinary wear and tear and damage by insured casualty. Tenant shall also, at its own cost and expense, keep the Action Outside Area (as well as the fencing abutting the Action Outside Area) in good, clean, operating order, condition and repair, shall make all necessary repairs, repaving and replacement of the Action Outside Area necessary to keep the same in good operating order, condition and repair, and shall be responsible for keeping the Action Outside Area free from snow, ice, rubbish and debris and for adequately illuminating and draining the same. Parking spaces in the Action Outside Area shall, at all times, be clearly marked by painting, striping or otherwise by Action, at Action's sole cost and expense. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that Tenant shall not make or suffer any waste or damage to the Leased Premises or the Action Outside Area and shall make all necessary repairs, replacements and renewals thereof, as and when needed in order to keep the Leased Premises and the Action Outside Area (and abutting fencing) in good operating order and condition. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that Tenant shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, replacement and renewal of (i) all electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing, gas, sprinkler, drainage and other equipment and utility or other systems which exclusively serve the Leased Premises, (ii) the roof of the Leased Premises and the slabs, floors, foundation, walls and structural elements of the Leased Premises, (iii) all fixtures and interior walls, ceilings, signs (including exterior signs, where permitted) within the Leased Premises and portions of any common walls of the Leased Premises which serve the Leased Premises, (iv) the exterior and interior portion of all windows, all window frames, doors, door frames and all other glass or plate glass thereon within the Leased Premises or the walls thereof or serving the Leased Premises, (v) all paving, curbs, gutters, grass, landscaping, drainage systems and lines located in or serving the Action Outside Area and (vi) the outside lighting serving the Action Outside Area. (b) Landlord shall be obligated to maintain the Common Outside Area, including the maintenance and repair thereof and Landlord shall also be responsible for keeping the Common Outside Area free from snow, ice, rubbish and debris, and for adequately illuminating and draining the same (all of the costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with performance of its obligations under this Section 4.7(b) are hereinafter called the "Common Outside Area Expenses"). (c) Landlord shall also be obligated to maintain the Common Building Utility Systems (as said term is hereinafter defined) including the maintenance and repair thereof. All costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Section 4.7(c) shall be included within the term "CAM Charges". As used herein, the term "Common Building Utility Systems" shall mean the portion of any and all utility lines and systems and drain lines serving the Buildings and/or the Leased Premises, including, but not limited to, gas, water, sewer and electric lines, from the point where they enter or leave the Leased Premises to the point outside the Buildings where the applicable utility company assumes control of such line, together with (i) the water tank located outside the Buildings which serve the sprinkler system, (ii) the gas storage shed located outside the Buildings, (iii) the drain lines and systems outside the Buildings and (iv) any and all utility lines and drain lines located within the Leased Premises which are below the slab. (d) As used in this Lease, the term "CAM Charges" shall include the costs incurred for operation, maintenance and repair of the common areas existing at the Property, and for the replacement of its component parts and structural elements, including but not limited to the structural elements of the Buildings located on the Land; the electrical, gas, sprinkler, plumbing, drainage, water, sewage and HVAC systems which serve the Property or Buildings in common with other tenants or space in the Property (including, without limitation, the Common Building Utility Systems; all areas exterior to the Leased Premises, including but not limited to entrances, exits, passageways, sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, lighting facilities, landscaped areas and utility lines; together with the cost of cleaning, painting, striping, and adequate illumination for such elements of the Property; except that (i) any expense included as a Common Outside Area Expense, (ii) any expense which, under any other provision of this Lease, is to be borne entirely by Tenant, (iii) any expense of maintaining, repairing, replacing or renewing the roof, exterior walls (other than walls which are common to the Leased Premises and other parts of the Building), foundation, floors, windows and glass in the Buildings, (iv) any expense of maintaining, repairing, replacing or renewing any electric, plumbing, gas, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, sprinkler, drainage or other equipment and utility systems which exclusively serve only parts of the Buildings other than the Leased Premises and (v) any electric, gas or water charges which are paid by Tenant under Section 4.9 hereof, shall not be included in CAM Charges. Such CAM Charges (insofar as they are for replacements of a major capital structural item (the "Structural Replacements")) shall be fully included in CAM Charges when incurred. Upon termination (other than as a result of (i) a default of Tenant or (ii) a termination in connection with a substitution of a subtenant in accordance with Section 3.2 hereof) of this Lease, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the unamortized cost of such Structural Replacement item (to the extent theretofore paid by Tenant as a CAM Charge hereunder) in an amount equal to the remaining number of full years of the useful life of the Structural Replacement (as of the date of such expiration of the Lease) as apportioned at the time the structural replacement was made, multiplied by the Annualized Cost of the Improvement (as said term is hereinafter defined) pro-rated in the case of any period of less than one (1) year; provided, however, that the provisions of this sentence shall not be binding upon or enforceable against EWI, its successors, assigns or transferees or designees under the purchase option set forth in the EWI Lease or against any purchaser. As used herein, the term "Annualized Cost of the Improvement" shall mean the cost of the improvement apportioned equally over annual periods equal to the agreed upon useful life of the Structural Replacement in question, which shall be deemed to be the period of time applicable to the depreciable life of the Structural Replacement at the time of replacement under Internal Revenue Service Guidelines or a shorter period if the manufacturer of the replacements items specifies a shorter useful life. Notwithstanding the breadth of the definition of CAM Charges, nothing in this Section 4.7(d) shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly, expand the obligation of Landlord with respect to maintenance, repair, replacement or operation of the Property beyond those expressly set forth in Sections 4.7(b) and 4.7(c) of this Lease or to imply that Landlord has any obligations with respect to maintenance, repair, replacement or operation of the Property beyond the obligations set forth in Sections 4.7(b) and 4.7(c). CAM Charges may also include a reasonable management fee and reasonable overhead charges of Landlord. (e) Whichever party is performing maintenance, repair or replacement of the Common Outside Area and obligations under this Section shall do so in compliance with all present and future laws, ordinances, orders, rules, regulations, notices of violations and requirements of public authorities applicable thereto, whether or not by law tenants may have such duty or responsibility solely or jointly with a landlord, except that in no event shall Landlord have any obligation to correct any failure of the Property (or any part thereof or system thereon or use thereof) to, as of the Commencement Date, comply with any such laws, ordinances, rules or regulations). (f) Tenant agrees to pay Tenant's Pro Rata Share (i.e. 9.98%) of the CAM Charges and Tenant's Pro Rate Share (i.e. 25%) of Common Outside Area Expenses, as hereinafter provided. Landlord shall bill Tenant monthly for Tenant's Pro Rata Share of Common Outside Area Expenses and CAM Charges. Each such demand for payment shall include copies of invoices for charges incurred by Landlord together with a reasonably detailed statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and certified by Landlord's chief financial officer and containing actual costs and the calculation of Tenant's Pro Rata Share. Tenant's Pro Rata Share shall be paid within 30 days-of Landlord's demand therefor. Common Outside Area Expenses and CAM Charges payable by Tenant shall not include any debt service, any administrative personnel expense, any costs of Landlord's office space or office supplies. (g) Tenant shall have the right to audit Landlord's books and records to verify Landlord's calculation of Common Outside Area Expenses, CAM Charges and Tenant's Pro Rata Share. In the event of an error in Landlord's favor, Landlord shall immediately refund the overcharge to Tenant. In the event of an error in Tenant's favor, Tenant shall immediately pay the Landlord the amount underpaid. In the event of an error in Landlord's favor of more than four percent (4%) of the Common Outside Area Expenses and CAM Charges (as opposed to four percent (4%) of Tenant's Pro Rate Share thereof), Tenant shall also have the right to charge the reasonable expenses of any audit (conducted by an outside auditor) to Landlord. (h) If there is a dispute between Landlord and Tenant with respect to the amount of Common Outside Area Expense or CAM Charges assessed, or of Tenant's Pro Rata Share thereof, then Tenant shall pay both the disputed and undisputed amount when due to Landlord pending a resolution of such dispute. 4.8 Real Estate and Other Taxes. (a) Tenant shall be obligated each Lease Year or any portion thereof in which it is a tenant for the payment of its Pro Rata Share of all real estate taxes and assessments (at the discount rate provided Tenant pays its rent and Pro Rata Share of real estate taxes and assessments, insurance premiums, CAM Charges and Common Outside Area Expenses when due). Landlord shall be responsible for payment in the first instance of all such taxes and assessments on the Property. Upon receipt Landlord shall submit a bill to Tenant, together with photostatic copies of all tax bills and all notices concerning assessments, and a computation of Tenant's Pro Rata Share. Within 30 days of submission of each such bill and information, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord in the amount required by this Lease, and such reimbursement shall be deemed to be additional rent. Landlord shall have the right but not the obligation to appeal assessments on the Property, and Tenant shall pay its Pro Rata Share of the reasonable cost (including reasonable fees of attorneys and appraisers) of any such appeal pursued by Landlord to reduce any real estate taxes upon submission by Landlord to Tenant of copies of receipts for payments by Landlord of such costs. If by virtue of any appeal, application, or proceeding brought by or on behalf of Landlord there is a reduction in the real estate taxes assessed against the Property, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of such taxes shall be reduced accordingly or, if previously paid by Tenant, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of such reduction shall be paid over and refunded to Tenant upon receipt of such refund by Landlord. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Tenant's Pro Rata Share of reasonable cost and expenses incurred in connection with the appeal. (b) Real estate taxes and assessments as used herein means all real estate taxes and general and special assessments on real estate, or any tax imposed on or levied against real estate or owners of real estate in lieu of such taxes or assessments. Real estate taxes and assessments as used herein does not include any of the following, all of which shall be the sole obligation of Landlord: income, excise, profits, estate, inheritance, successor, franchise, capital or other tax or assessment upon Landlord or upon the rental receipts or other revenues of Landlord from the Property, except to the extent that rental receipts are taxed by the municipality in which the Property is located in lieu of other property taxes. (c) If Landlord receives an abatement, reduction, elimination, postponement, refund or other benefit related to the payment of such taxes and assessments, Tenant shall be entitled to the benefit thereof, to the extent of its Pro Rata Share. (d) For the years in which the Lease Term commences and terminates, Tenant shall pay only a proportionate share of real estate taxes and assessments payable under this Section based on a ratio of the Term within the tax year to the full tax year. If, as of the Commencement Date, Tenant has paid any real estate taxes in respect of portions of the Property other than the Leased Premises for periods occurring after the Commencement Date, then Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for all such taxes (after deducting Tenant's Pro Rata Share thereof under this Lease) paid in respect of such portions and periods within thirty (30) days of being billed therefor. If Landlord fails to make any such reimbursement when due and such failure continues for more than ten (10) days after written notice thereof, Tenant shall have the right to deduct the amount of such reimbursement from the next installment of Annual Office Rent due hereunder. (e) At Landlord's option, Landlord may require Tenant to pay into escrow in advance in 12 equal monthly installments its Pro Rata Share of such taxes and/or assessments with each monthly payment of rent hereunder. If Landlord exercises such option, all funds so received from Tenant shall be kept in a segregated, interest-bearing account which shall be used solely for paying real estate taxes and assessments. Tenant's Pro Rata Share of interest accrued in such interest bearing account shall be paid over to Tenant after the first day of each Lease Year within thirty (30) days after request therefor. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Paragraph 4.8(e) to the contrary, such funds will not bear interest if the first mortgagee of the Property is escrowing taxes unless such mortgagee agrees that such escrow shall be interest bearing, nor shall Tenant be entitled to receive payments of interest on any such funds unless and to the extent that any such mortgagee agrees to pay the same in accordance herewith. In no event will Landlord be in breach of its obligations hereunder if any such mortgagee does not agree to pay interest on such funds, refuses to pay interest to Tenant or fails to pay such interest when due. 4.9 Utilities. (a) Tenant covenants and agrees that its use of electric current shall not exceed the capacity of the systems, wiring and other electrical equipment which Landlord makes available to the Premises and its total connected load will not exceed the maximum load from time to time available to the Premises. Tenant shall not overload the electrical wiring or electrical panels within or serving the Premises and will install at its own expense, but only after obtaining Landlord's prior written approval, any additional electrical wiring or panels which may be required in connection with Tenant's apparatus. Landlord shall not in any way be liable or responsible to Tenant for any loss or damage or expense which Tenant may sustain or incur if, during the Term of this Lease, either the quantity or character of electric current is changed or electric current is no longer available or suitable for Tenant's requirements due to a factor or cause beyond Landlord's control. Tenant, at Tenant's expense, shall purchase and install any replacement lamps, tubes, bulbs, starters and ballasts which may be needed during the Term. Tenant shall pay all charges for electricity used or consumed in the Premises. Electricity is currently furnished to the entire Building through one meter which enters the Buildings through the Warehouse in premises being leased to Executive Warehouse, Inc. ("EWI"). EWI has the right, under its lease (the "EWI Lease") with Landlord to, if EWI so elects, install an electric sub-meter or sub-meters at EWI's sole cost and expense (which cost may be shared with Tenant in such proportion as EWI and Tenant may agree) in order to measure electrical usage by Tenant and EWI during each monthly electricity billing period. The EWI Lease provides that EWI will coordinate any such submeter installation with Tenant. The EWI Lease also provides that if EWI installs such sub-meter or sub-meters, EWI shall read the main meter and each submeter promptly at the end of each monthly electricity billing period and promptly furnish Landlord with the breakdown (the "Electric Breakdown") of electrical consumption between Tenant and EWI based on such readings. Tenant shall make arrangements with EWI to coordinate the reading of any such main electric meter and any such electric submeter. If, for any reason, Tenant has not received a statement of its share of electricity charges under this Section 4.9 by the end of each calendar month, Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord. Tenant shall pay its share of the electrical charge to Landlord each month upon the later to occur of (i) five (5) days after receipt of a statement for such electric charges or (ii) five (5) days before each related electric bill is due and payable. The cost of installation, maintenance and repair of any sub-meter which Tenant elects to install shall be borne by Tenant. Gas and water are also currently furnished to the Building through one gas meter and one water meter. Tenant may, if it so elects, install separate submeters for measurement of gas and/or water consumption by Tenant at Tenant's sole expense. The Tenant shall pay when due all charges for utility services provided directly to the Premises including, without limitation, electricity, gas, water, sewer and the cost of providing heating, ventilating and air-conditioning to the Premises. (b) Tenant, in cooperation with EWI, shall read each of the utility meters or submeters promptly at the end of each monthly electricity, sewer, water and gas billing period and shall promptly furnish Landlord with the results of each such reading. Tenant shall pay its share of all such electric, gas, sewer and water utility charges to Landlord each month at least five days before each related utility bill is due and payable. If electricity, water or gas consumed by the Premises is not metered or submetered separately from electricity, water or gas, as the case may be, consumed by the remainder of the Buildings, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within five (5) days of being billed therefor by Landlord (but, in any event, not sooner than five (5) days before such sums are, in fact, payable to the applicable utility company), Tenant's share of the aforesaid utilities determined as hereinafter set forth. Where there is no such separate meter or submeter installed to measure Tenant's consumption of electricity, sewer, water or gas, Landlord may, from time to time, determine Tenant's share of all such electric, gas, sewer and water charges based on estimates of relative consumption levels based on actual use (or estimated use if actual usage information is not available) prepared by an independent consulting or engineering firm experienced in making such estimates and, in such case, such estimates of the cost of providing electricity, gas, sewer and water to the Premises shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant. Until an estimate of usage is obtained from a consulting or engineering firm as contemplated by this Section 4.9(b), Landlord may estimate Tenant's share of all electric, sewer, water and gas expenses and require that Tenant pay such estimated amounts monthly in arrears on the last day of each calendar month during the Term. Landlord shall have the right to adjust monthly estimated payments on account of such utilities from time to time. If water is consumed in the Premises for purposes other than ordinary drinking and lavatory purposes or in excessive quantities or if Tenant's heating or cooling requirements are materially greater than the requirements of other tenants, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord, on demand from time to time, charges for such additional water, heating or cooling as Landlord may require. (c) Landlord shall not be liable for any interruption of electricity, gas, water, telephone, sewage, HVAC and/or septic system or other utility service supplied to the Premises and Landlord reserves the right to stop any service or utility to the Premises, when in Landlord's reasonable judgment it is deemed necessary by reason of accident, emergency or repair or otherwise; and no such interruption or stoppage shall be deemed to be an eviction of Tenant or relieve Tenant from any obligations under this Lease; in the event any such curtailment, suspension, interruption or stoppage becomes necessary by reason of the foregoing, Landlord will use all reasonable efforts to restore the affected service or services as promptly as possible and to minimize, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances, any interference, disruption, suspension or interruption of Tenant's use and enjoyment of the Leased Premises by reason thereof. (d) All sums payable under this Section 4.9 shall constitute additional rent. In the event of nonpayment of any sums due under this Section 4.9, Landlord shall have all the same rights and remedies available as in the case of nonpayment of Annual Rent. 4.10 Tenant's Alterations. (a) Tenant may, at its own cost and expense and only with the prior written approval of Landlord which may be given or withheld by Landlord, in its sole discretion, make structural, mechanical and electrical changes or alterations to the Leased Premises subject, however, to Section 4.10(d) hereof. All work done in connection with such changes or alterations shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner in compliance with applicable building codes and zoning requirements and all other laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. Landlord agrees to execute all instruments necessary to obtain licenses and permits from applicable governmental authorities to make such changes or alterations provided that Landlord incurs no obligation, liability or out-of-pocket expense in connection therewith. (b) Together with each request for the consent of Landlord, Tenant shall present to Landlord reasonably detailed plans and specifications for such proposed structural alterations, improvements, additions or changes; provided, however, that approval of such plans and specifications by Landlord shall not constitute any assumption of any responsibility by Landlord for their accuracy or sufficiency, and Tenant shall be solely responsible for such items. All structural alterations, improvements, additions or changes shall be done at the expense of Tenant. (c) All alterations, improvements, additions, repairs or changes made by Tenant shall remain upon the Property at the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term and shall become the property of Landlord immediately upon installation thereof. (d) Tenant may, at its own cost and expense, but with the prior approval of Landlord, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld so long as the requested changes and alterations do not adversely affect the leasability or marketability of the Premises or any part thereof as determined by Landlord, (i) make non-structural, non- mechanical and non-electrical changes and alterations in and to the interior of the Leased Premises, including but not limited to installation of fixtures, equipment and floor coverings, painting and papering and (ii) may reconfigure non load bearing interior walls and make related changes in the location of electrical outlets and related changes to the heating and air conditioning system serving the Leased Premises in connection with a reconfiguration of the Premises and provided, further, that no such reconfiguration, relocation or change shall adversely affect the Building, the Premises, Landlord's Recapture Right or any electric, HVAC or other system serving the Leased Premises or other parts of the Buildings. Landlord shall have the right to require Tenant to remove any non-structural changes and alterations made by Tenant to walls, floors, partitions, ceilings and fixtures at the conclusion of this Lease to the extent that the value or marketability of all or any part of the Premises which is or may be recaptured by Landlord under Article 7 is adversely affected or the value of the Premises (or any part thereof) is diminished by such changes and alterations, but in no event shall Tenant be required to remove any change or alteration approved in writing by Landlord at the time of alteration or installation unless such approval states otherwise. (e) Tenant may not make structural or non-structural changes to the exterior of the Buildings without the prior written consent of Landlord. 4.11 Landlord's Reserved Rights. The Premises are leased subject to the reservation to the Landlord of the roof and exterior walls of the Premises and of the Building, and subject to the Landlord's reservation of the right (without thereby assuming the obligation) to install, maintain, use, repair and replace (in such manner as to reduce to a minimum to the extent reasonably practicable the interference with Tenant's use of the Premises) all pipes, ducts, wires, meters, utility lines and the like which are in the reasonable judgment of the Landlord, required to be in the Premises or are required for other parts of the Buildings. The Landlord further reserves the right to make additions to the Building from time to time and to erect additional buildings, improvements and structures on the land, and in connection therewith to tie into and make use of common facilities serving the Premises including without limitation the electrical systems, the plumbing systems, the heating systems, sewer, water, and other facilities and appurtenances serving Premises. The Landlord reserves the right to alter, reduce, increase and relocate the parking areas, driveways and walkways from time to time and any common facilities within or outside the Building; provided, however, that any such reduction, alteration or relocation does not materially adversely affect Tenant's use of the Leased Premises. 4.12 Signs. Tenant shall be entitled to retain existing signs on the exterior and interior of the Property and Buildings except to the extent such signage is required to be removed by a new tenant under Article 7. Any additional exterior signs may be erected by Tenant only with the prior written consent of Landlord. Any signs erected by Tenant shall be installed and any existing and future signs of Tenant shall be maintained by Tenant in good repair at the sole cost and expense of Tenant. At the end of the Lease Term (whether by expiration or earlier termination of the Term) or if Tenant no longer occupies the Property as its primary headquarters or no longer occupies all of the Offices existing at the date of this Lease, Tenant will, at Landlord's request, remove Tenant's signage and repair any damage caused by such removal. 4.13 Landlord's Waiver. (a) Except for the Personalty listed in Section 1.16 of the Agreement of Sale and Purchase dated as of June 29, 1990 between Landlord and Tenant (the "Purchase Agreement"), all machinery, equipment, furniture, Tenant's business fixtures and inventory which are or may be installed or placed in or upon the Leased Premises by Tenant (exclusive of any HVAC, electrical, plumbing, lighting, equipment, ceiling tiles and finishes, floor coverages and leasehold improvements) ("Tenant's Personal Property") shall remain the property of Tenant. Landlord waives any right it may have in Tenant's Personal Property. Tenant may assign, lien, encumber, mortgage, or create a security interest in or upon Tenant's Personal Property without the consent of Landlord and may remove Tenant's Personal Property at any time during the Lease Term, provided, however, that T  enant shall promptly repair any damage caused by such removal. Upon the request of Tenant, Landlord agrees to provide to Tenant within 10 days of such request, a written waiver in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D or in a form reasonably satisfactory to any of Tenant's lenders evidencing Landlord's waiver of any rights it has or may have in Tenant's Personal Property. If Landlord fails to execute such waiver of rights, any of Tenant's lenders may enforce the provisions of this Section as a third-party beneficiary hereof. (b) To the extent that Landlord may have a lien on or security interest in Tenant's Personal Property pursuant to this Lease, by law or otherwise, Landlord hereby waives and agrees not to assert such lien or security interest. Landlord shall execute such additional waivers in the form substantially attached hereto as Exhibit D for the benefit of Tenant's lenders as Tenant may, from time to time, reasonably request. 4.14 Access to Property. (a) Subject to any governmental requirements and so long as Landlord does not adversely interfere with Tenant's use of the Leased Premises, the Common Outside Area or the Action Outside Area, Landlord may change the entrance, exit and approaches, and means of entrance, exit and approach, now existing on the Property. Landlord shall have the right to alter or expand the existing entrance and exit to and from the Property, add or authorize any person to add any additional means of ingress or egress or grant to any other tenant in the Property any such right or authority so long as such alteration or expansion does not materially and adversely interfere with Tenant's use of the Leased Premises. (b) Landlord has the right (but not the responsibility) to enter the Property periodically and shall have access to the Leased Premises and the Action Outside Area, at reasonable business hours, for inspection (and to show the Premises to prospective tenants) and to make any repairs or replacements required of it to be made or to notify Tenant of reasonable repairs and replacements which are required of Tenant to be made; provided, however, that Landlord shall notify Tenant's facilities manager in advance of such inspections, repairs or replacements, Landlord's employees, agents and contractors shall identify themselves to such person upon entering the Property and Landlord will use reasonable efforts to minimize, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances, interference, disruption, suspension or interruption of Tenant's use and enjoyment of the Leased Premises by reason thereof. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, Landlord may enter the Lease Premises and the Action Outside Area at any time in the case of an emergency, without notifying Tenant in advance. 4.15 Insurance. (a) Tenant, at its own cost and-expense, will keep in force with companies licensed to do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: (i) Comprehensive general liability, personal injury and personal property damage insurance with respect to the Leased Premises and the business operated therein with a combined single limit of $1,000,000. The policy or policies shall (A) provide that any loss shall be paid notwithstanding any act or negligence of Landlord or Tenant, (B) name Landlord as an additional insured thereunder, as its interests may appear, and (C) extend to any liability of Tenant arising out of the indemnities, and be subject to the waiver of subrogation, provided in Section 4.16. Tenant shall also keep in force, at its own expense, workers' compensation or similar insurance affording statutory coverage and compensation and containing statutory limits. (ii) Fire insurance with standard broad-form endorsements for extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief and sprinkler leakage, and all-risk casualty insurance with replacement cost endorsement and with a deductible of not more than $50,000, covering all of Tenant's furniture, equipment and other personal property in the Leased Premises. (b) Landlord will keep in force with companies licensed to do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (or cause to be kept in force) such fire insurance with such endorsements for extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief, sprinkler leakage and other coverages, and such all-risk casualty insurance, in such case, in such amounts, and with such endorsements and deductibles, with respect to the Property as Landlord may elect. (c) All such insurance policies shall provide that losses shall be payable notwithstanding any act or negligence of any named insured if such clause is obtainable from the insurance company. Tenant and Landlord shall have the right to carry any or all of its insurance under "blanket policies." Duly executed certificates evidencing the coverage required hereunder of Tenant shall be delivered to Landlord within 10 days after receipt, together with all portions of the policy relating to the Property. Such certificates shall specify that no cancellations shall be effective until 30 days after written notice to Landlord thereof, except in case of nonpayment in which case cancellation shall be effective 10 days after written notice, unless a longer period is available. (d) During each Lease Year of the Term, Tenant shall pay Landlord, as additional rent hereunder, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of Landlord's cost of all insurance on the Building and the Land (whether purchased directly by Landlord or by any other tenant or party). Such insurance costs shall including, without limitation, the costs for fire and extended coverage insurance and such other insurance covering all hazards included within customary "all risks" coverage, including without limitation insurance covering fire, lightning, vandalism, malicious mischief, and sprinkler leakage, business interruption and rent insurance, said insurance to be on a full value, repair, or replacement basis, as determined by Landlord and Landlords cost for comprehensive liability insurance indemnifying the Landlord (and any other party) against all claims and demands for any injury to persons or property which may be claimed to have occurred in or upon the Building or the Land in such amounts as Landlord shall from time to time determine. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall pay as additional rent, one hundred (100%) percent of Landlord's cost of any insurance with respect to the Building or the Land which is attributable solely to Tenant's particular use of the Premises. All additional rent on account of insurance shall be paid to Landlord within fifteen (15) days of receipt by Tenant of a bill therefor from Landlord, which bill shall be accompanied by a copy of the applicable insurance bills and a computation showing Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the cost thereof, or, at the election of the Landlord, in advance in twelve (12) equal monthly estimated installments (based on an amount estimated by Landlord) due and payable on the same dates as the monthly installments of Base Rent payable hereunder, with a final adjustment to be made as soon as all applicable bills are available for such period. 4.16 Indemnifications, Mutual Release, and Waiver of Subrogation Tenant will defend and indemnify Landlord and hold it harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, liability and expense (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with the loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to property arising from, related to or in connection with the maintenance, occupancy or use of the Property by Tenant or occasioned by any negligent act or omission of Tenant. Landlord will defend and indemnify Tenant and hold it harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, liability and expense (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with the loss of life, bodily injury or damage to property of third persons occasioned by any negligent act or omission of Landlord. The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination or earlier expiration of this Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, Landlord and Tenant hereby each release the other and anyone claiming through or under the other by way of subrogation or otherwise from any and all liability, claims and demands whatsoever, for any loss or damage to the property of one party, occurring through or as a result of any acts or omissions, whether or not caused by negligence or fault of the other party or its contractors or subcontractors or their agents or employees, to the extent of any recovery made by the waiving party hereto for such loss or damage under any fire and extended-coverage insurance policy now or hereafter issued covering the Buildings. In addition, Landlord and Tenant shall cause each such insurance policy carried by them insuring the Buildings or the contents thereof to be written to provide that the insurer waives all rights of recovery by way of subrogation against the other party hereto in connection with any loss or damage covered by the policy, if such waiver is obtainable without additional cost (or if there is an additional cost, the other party shall pay such cost within 10 days following written notice thereof). 4.17 [Intentionally Omitted] 4.18 [Intentionally Omitted] 4.19 Tenant's Default. (a) If at any time subsequent to the date of this Lease any one or more of the following events (herein referred to as a "Default of Tenant") shall happen: (i) Tenant shall fail to pay the Annual Rent, additional rent, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of taxes and assessments, insurance premiums or of CAM Charges or Common Outside Area Expenses or other sums or charges payable by Tenant hereunder when due and Tenant shall fail to remedy the same within ten (10) days after notice thereof to Tenant; or (ii) Tenant shall fail to comply with the provisions of Article 7 and such failure shall continue for more than two (2) days after written notice; or (iii) Tenant shall neglect or fail to perform or observe any other covenant herein contained on Tenant's part to be performed or observed and Tenant shall fail to remedy the same within thirty (30) days after notice to Tenant specifying such neglect or failure, or if such failure is of such a nature that Tenant cannot reasonably remedy the same within such thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall fail to commence promptly to remedy the same and to prosecute such remedy to completion with diligence and continuity; or (iv) Tenant's leasehold interest in the Leased Premises shall be taken on execution or by other process of law directed against Tenant; or (v) Tenant shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or shall be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent, or shall file any petition or answer seeking any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief for itself under any present or future Federal, State or other statute, law or regulation for the relief of debtors, or shall seek or consent to or acquiesce in the appointment of any trustee, receiver or liquidator of Tenant or of all or any substantial part of its properties, or shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due; or (vi) A petition shall be filed against Tenant in bankruptcy or under any other law seeking any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution, or similar relief under any present or future Federal, State or other statute, law or regulation and shall remain undismissed or unstayed for an aggregate of ninety (90) days (whether or not consecutive), or if any debtor in possession (whether or not Tenant) trustee, receiver or liquidator of Tenant or of all or any substantial part of its properties or of the Leased Premises shall be appointed without the consent or acquiescence of Tenant and such appointment shall remain unvacated or unstayed for an aggregate of ninety (90) days (whether or not consecutive); then in any such case, Landlord may terminate this Lease by notice to Tenant, and thereupon this Lease shall come to an end as fully and completely as if such date were the date herein originally fixed for the expiration of the Term of this Lease, and Tenant will then quit and surrender the Premises to Landlord, but Tenant shall remain liable as hereinafter provided. (b) If this Lease shall be terminated as provided in this Section 4.19, or if any execution or attachment shall be issued against Tenant or any of Tenant's property whereupon the Leased Premises shall be taken or occupied by someone other than Tenant, Tenant shall surrender and deliver up the Premises to Landlord, and, upon any default in doing so, then Landlord may, without notice, re-enter the Premises, either by force, summary proceedings, ejectment or otherwise, and remove and dispossess Tenant and all other persons and any and all property from the same, as if this Lease had not been made, and to apply for the appointment of a receiver and for other ancillary relief in such action, provided that Tenant shall have ten (10) days' written notice (or such longer notice as applicable law may provide) after such application for a receiver or other ancillary relief is filed and before any hearing thereon, and, in such event, Landlord shall have and enjoy the said Premises, fully and completely, as if this Lease had never been made. (c) In the event of any termination, Tenant shall pay the Annual Rent, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of real estate taxes and assessments and insurance premiums, CAM Charges, Common Outside Area Expenses and also all other additional rent and other sums payable hereunder up to the time of such termination, and thereafter Tenant, until the end of what would have been the Term of this Lease in the absence of such termination, and whether or not the Leased Premises shall have been relet, shall be liable to Landlord for, and shall pay to Landlord, as liquidated current damages, the Annual Rent, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of real estate taxes and assessments, insurance premiums, CAM Charges, Common Outside Area Expenses and also all other additional rent and other sums which would be payable hereunder if such termination had not occurred, less the net proceeds, if any, of any reletting of the Leased Premises, after deducting from the net proceeds of such reletting all reasonable expenses in connection with such reletting (amortized, to the extent permitted by generally accepted accounting principles, over the term of such re-letting or such other period as may be appropriate under the circumstances), including, without limitation, all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, legal expenses, attorneys' fees, advertising, expenses of employees, alteration costs and expenses of preparation for such reletting. Tenant shall pay such current damages to Landlord monthly on the days which the Annual Rent and additional rent would have been payable hereunder if this Lease had not been terminated. (d) At any time after such termination, whether or not Landlord shall have collected any such current damages, as liquidated final damages and in lieu of all such current damages beyond the date of such demand, at Landlord's election Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to the present value (using a discount rate of 8.5%) the excess, if any, of the rent, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of taxes, insurance premiums and of CAM Charges and Common Outside Area Expenses and additional rent and other sums as hereinbefore provided which would be payable hereunder from the date of such demand (assuming that, for the purposes of this paragraph, annual payments by Tenant on account of taxes, insurance premiums, CAM Charges and Common Outside Area Expenses and other expenses would be the same as the payments required for the immediately preceding lease year) for what would be the then unexpired Term of this Lease if the same had remained in effect, over the then fair net rental value of the Leased Premises for the same period (assuming, for this purpose, the same level of Landlord services as are provided in this Lease). (e) In the case of any such termination, re-entry, expiration or dispossession by summary proceeding or otherwise, Landlord may (i) re-let the Leased Premises or any part or parts thereof, either in the name of Landlord or otherwise, for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option be equal to or less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term of this Lease and may grant concessions or free rent to the extent that Landlord considers advisable and reasonably necessary to re-let the same and (ii) may make such reasonable alterations, repairs and decorations in the Leased Premises as Landlord in its reasonable judgment considers advisable and necessary for the purpose of reletting the Leased Premises; and the making of such alterations, repairs and decorations shall not operate or be construed to release Tenant from liability hereunder as aforesaid. Landlord shall in no event be liable in any way whatsoever for failure to re-let the Leased Premises, or, in the event that the Leased Premises are re-let, for failure to collect the rent under such re-letting. Landlord will, however, use good faith efforts to re-let the Leases Premises. Tenant hereby expressly waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws in the event of Tenant being evicted or dispossessed, or in the event of Landlord obtaining possession of the Leased Premises, by reason of the violation by Tenant of any of the covenants and conditions of this Lease. (f) In addition to all other rights and remedies which Landlord may have under the Lease, at law or in equity, upon the occurrence of any Default of Tenant, Landlord shall also have the following right: Any prothonotary or attorney of any court of record may appear for Tenant in amicable actions in ejectment, and may sign for Tenant an agreement, for which this Lease shall be his sufficient warrant, for entering in any competent court an amicable action or actions in ejectment, and in any suits or in said amicable actions to confess judgment against Tenant as well as all persons claiming by, through or under Tenant for the recovery by Landlord of possession of the Leased Premises. Such authority shall not be exhausted by any one or more exercises thereof, but judgment may be confessed from time to time as often as a Tenant's Default shall have occurred or be continuing. Such powers may be exercised during as well as after the expiration extension or renewal of the Lease Term. (g) The specified remedies to which Landlord may resort hereunder are not intended to be exclusive of any remedies or means of redress to which Landlord may at any time be entitled to lawfully, and Landlord may invoke any remedy (including the remedy of specific performance) allowed at law or in equity as if specific remedies were not herein provided for. (h) All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Landlord (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in enforcing its rights hereunder or occasioned by any Default of Tenant shall be paid by Tenant. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease: (i) Landlord shall not have any right to accelerate rent and other amounts payable hereunder except to the extent provided in this Lease. (ii) Landlord shall not have any right to exercise its remedies hereunder if Tenant cures a Default of Tenant prior to the effective date of Landlord's termination of this Lease (but not more than two times in the aggregate in any 12-month period as to all defaults). The provisions of this clause (ii) above shall not apply to failure to pay Annual Rent, or Tenant's Pro Rata Share of real estate taxes and assessments, insurance premiums, CAM Charges or Common Outside Area Expenses, or any other additional rent or charges payable by Tenant under this Lease nor to a failure to comply with Article 7. (iii) In the event of any Tenant Default under this Lease, Landlord shall in each case use its good faith efforts to mitigate its damages. (j) In the event of a Default of Tenant, any amounts paid by Landlord to cure such default and any rents due and payable by Tenant shall bear interest at the rate payable by Landlord to its first mortgage lender. (k) Except as otherwise provided in this Section, all remedies available to Landlord hereunder and at law and in equity shall be cumulative and concurrent. No termination of the Lease nor taking or recovering possession of the Leased Premises shall deprive Landlord of any remedies or actions against Tenant for Annual Rent or Tenant's Pro Rata Share of real estate taxes and assessments or any other additional rent or for charges or for damages for the breach of any covenant, agreement or condition herein contained, nor shall the bringing of any such action for Annual Rent, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of real estate taxes and assessments, insurance premiums, CAM Charges and Common Outside Area Expenses and other additional rent or charges or breach of covenant, agreement or condition, nor the resort to any other remedy or right for the recovery of Annual Rent, Tenant's Pro Rate Share of real estate taxes and assessments and insurance premiums, CAM Charges, Common Outside Area Expenses, additional rent or other charges or damages for such breach, be construed as a waiver or release of the right to insist upon the forfeiture and to obtain possession. (l) Any failure of Landlord to enforce any remedy allowed for the violation of any provision of this Lease shall not imply the waiver of any such provision, even if such violation is continued or repeated, and no express waiver shall affect any provision other than the one(s) specified in such waiver and only for the time and in the manner specifically stated. 4.20 Landlord Default. Landlord shall in no event be in default of the performance of any of Landlord's obligations hereunder unless and until Landlord shall have unreasonably failed to perform such obligation within a period of time reasonably required to correct any such default, after notice by Tenant to Landlord specifying wherein Landlord has failed to perform any such obligations. If Landlord is determined to be in default, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the amounts paid by Tenant, including costs and attorneys' fees, together with interest thereon at the rate payable by Landlord to its primary lender. 4.21 Fire and Other Casualty; Eminent Domain. (a) Abatement Of Rent. If the Leased Premises shall be damaged by fire or casualty, Annual Rent, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of real estate taxes and assessments and insurance premiums, CAM Charges and Common Outside Area Expenses and other charges and additional rent payable by Tenant shall abate proportionately for the period in which, by reason of such damage, there is substantial interference with Tenant's use of the Leased Premises, having regard to the extent to which Tenant may be required to discontinue Tenant's use of all or a portion of the Leased Premises, but such abatement or reduction shall end if and when Landlord shall have substantially restored the Leased Premises (excluding any alterations, additions or improvements made by Tenant pursuant to this Lease) to the condition in which they were prior to such damage. If the Leased Premises shall be affected by any exercise of the power of eminent domain, Annual Rent, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of real estate taxes and assessments and insurance premiums, CAM Charges and Common Outside Area Expenses and additional rent payable by Tenant shall be justly and equitably abated and reduced according to the nature and extent of the loss of use thereof suffered by Tenant. In no event shall Landlord have any liability for damages to Tenant for inconvenience, annoyance, or interruption of business arising from such fire, casualty or eminent domain. (b) Landlord's Right Of Termination. If (i) the Premises or the Building are substantially damaged by fire or casualty (the term "substantially damaged" meaning damage of such a character that the same cannot, in ordinary course, reasonably be expected to be repaired within one hundred eighty (180) days from the time the repair work would commence), or (ii) if any part of the Building is taken by any exercise of the right of eminent domain, or (iii) any mortgagee then holding a mortgage on the Property or on any interest of Landlord therein should require that insurance proceeds or awards payable as the result of any fire, casualty or taking be applied toward the applicable mortgage debt rather than to restoration of the Building, then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease (even if Landlord's entire interest in the Leased Premises may have been divested) by giving notice of Landlord's election so to do within forty five (45) days after the occurrence of such casualty or the effective date of such taking, whereupon this Lease shall terminate thirty (30) days after the date of such notice with the same force and effect as if such date were the date originally established as the expiration date hereof. (c) Restoration. If this Lease shall not be terminated pursuant to Section 4.21(b), 4.21(d) or 4.21(e) and provided that (a) the Leased Premises, Building or part thereof, can be lawfully restored to substantially its former condition under applicable zoning, building, and other laws and (b) any first mortgagee with respect to the Property shall make the proceeds of insurance or condemnation awards related thereto available for restoration, Landlord shall thereafter use due diligence to restore the Leased Premises (excluding any alterations, additions or improvements made by Tenant) to proper condition for Tenant's use and occupation, provided that Landlord's obligation shall be limited to the amount of insurance proceeds actually made available to Landlord therefor. If, for any reason, such restoration shall not be substantially completed within six months after the expiration of the forty five (45) day period referred to in Section 4.21(b) (which six-month period may be extended for such periods of time as Landlord is prevented from proceeding with or completing such restoration by reason of a Force Majeure Event or for any other cause beyond Landlord's reasonable control, but in no event for more than an additional three months), Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving notice to Landlord thereof within thirty (30) days after the expiration of such period (as so extended). Upon the giving of such notice, this Lease shall cease and come to an end without further liability or obligation on the part of either party unless, within such 30-day period, Landlord substantially completes such restoration. Such right of termination shall be Tenant's sole and exclusive remedy at law or in equity for Landlord's failure so to complete such restoration. (d) If, within two years prior to the expiration of the Lease Term, more than 50% of the Leased Premises shall be substantially damaged or destroyed by fire or any other casualty, and the estimated time required for restoration exceeds six months, Tenant shall have the option of terminating this Lease 60 days after written notice to Landlord, such written notice to Landlord to be given within 30 days after such destruction or damage. (e) In the event that (i) more than 25% of the Leased Premises are taken by any public authority or utility under the power of eminent domain or (ii) if more than 25% of the Property is taken by any public authority and as a result of such taking Tenant's business is, in its reasonable judgment, materially adversely affected thereby, then, within 60 days of any of the above, Tenant will have the irrevocable right to terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord, in which case all rent and other sums due hereunder shall abate as of the date of the taking. (f) Award. Landlord shall have and hereby reserves and excepts, and Tenant hereby grants and assigns to Landlord, all rights to recover for damages to the Property, the Leased Premises and the leasehold interest hereby created, and to compensation accrued or hereafter to accrue by reason of such taking, damage or destruction, and by way of confirming the foregoing, Tenant hereby grants and assigns, and covenants with Landlord to grant and assign to Landlord, all rights to such damages or compensation. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent Tenant from, at its sole cost and expense, prosecuting a separate condemnation proceeding with respect to a claim for the value of any of Tenant's Personal Property installed in the Leased Premises by Tenant at Tenant's expense and for relocation expenses, provided that such action shall not affect the amount of compensation otherwise recoverable by Landlord from the taking authority. (g) No Liability On Account Of Injury To Business, Etc. Landlord shall not be liable for any inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant or injury to the business of Tenant or resulting in any way from damage from fire or other casualty or the repair thereof and Tenant understands and agrees that Landlord shall in no event be responsible for the repair or replacement of any furniture or furnishings or any fixtures or equipment removable by Tenant under the provisions of this Lease. If Tenant desires any other or additional repairs or Restoration and if Landlord consents thereto, the same shall be done at Tenant's expense. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord shall be entitled to the full proceeds of any insurance coverage whether carried by Landlord or Tenant, for damage to the Leased Premises and any alterations or improvements thereto. Upon any expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, any insurance proceeds not theretofore applied to the cost of Restoration shall be paid to Landlord. Tenant acknowledges that the fire and extended coverage insurance carried by Landlord shall not extend to Tenant's Personal Property, including trade fixtures, floor coverings, furniture and other property removable by Tenant and that Tenant shall be responsible for carrying fire, casualty, malicious mischief, sprinkler leakage and all risk insurance on all such personal property, trade fixtures, floor coverings, furniture and other property removable by it. 4.22 Financial Statements. Tenant shall, from time to time, deliver to Landlord, within thirty (30) days after request, a current annual certified financial statement, including operating statements and balance sheets, for Tenant. All such financial statements shall be prepared and certified by an independent certified public accounting firm and shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. 4.23 Subordination of Lease. (a) Landlord reserves the right to subject and subordinate this Lease at all times to the lien of any first mortgage, deed of trust, land lease or other security document having first priority, now or hereafter placed upon Landlord's interest in the Property, and to all advances made thereunder and to the interest therein, and all renewals and modifications thereof, all on such terms and conditions as the holder of any such first mortgage customarily requires. Tenant shall, upon written request, and from time to time, promptly execute and deliver, without charge and in form satisfactory to the Landlord and any such mortgagee, all instruments and documents that may be requested to acknowledge such subordination in recordable form within ten (10) days of such request. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, any Landlord mortgagee may at any time subordinate its mortgage to this Lease, without Tenant's consent, by execution of a written document subordinating such mortgage to this Lease to the extent set forth therein, and thereupon this Lease shall be deemed prior to such mortgage to the extent set forth in such written document without regard to their respective dates of execution, delivery or recording. In that event, to the extent set forth in such written document, such mortgagee shall have the same rights with respect to this Lease as though this Lease had been executed and this Lease or memorandum thereof recorded prior to the execution, delivery, and recording of the mortgage. Should Landlord or any mortgagee or purchaser desire confirmation of either such subordination or attornment, as the case may be, Tenant upon written request, and from time to time, will promptly execute and deliver without charge and in form satisfactory to Landlord, the mortgagee or the purchaser all instruments and documents that may be requested to acknowledge such subordination or agreement to attorn, in recordable form, within 10 days of such request.

Each of the parties hereto covenants to the other that this Lease shall not be recorded by either of them. However, on the Commencement Date, Landlord and Tenant shall execute a short-form lease for recording, which shall contain such form and substance as either party shall reasonably request, with the exception of the rent reserved hereunder. Upon the termination of this Lease, Tenant shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver to Landlord an instrument in writing releasing and quitclaiming to Landlord all right, rifle, and interest of Tenant in and to the Property arising from this Lease or otherwise, all without cost or expense to Landlord. 5.3 Entire Agreement.

In construing this Lease, feminine or neuter pronouns will be substituted for those masculine in form and vice versa, and plural terms will be substituted for singular and singular for plural in any place in which the context so requires. This Lease shall be construed without regard to the identity of the party who drafted the various provisions hereof. Moreover, each and every provision of this Lease shall be construed as though all parties hereto participated equally in the drafting thereof. As a result of the foregoing, any rule or construction that a document is to be construed against the drafting party will not be applicable hereto. 5.6 Table of Contents, Paragraph Headings. The table of contents and paragraph headings are inserted only for convenience and in no way define, limit or describe the scope or intent of this Lease, nor in any way affect this Lease. 5.7 No Joint Venture or Partnership Created by Lease. It is hereby understood and agreed that nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed by the parties hereto nor by any third party as creating the relationship of principal and agent or of partnership or of joint venture between the parties hereto, it being agreed that no provision herein contained nor any acts or the parties herein will be deemed to create any relationship between the parties hereto other than the relationship of Landlord and Tenant. 5.8 Broker's Commission. Landlord and Tenant represent and warrant to each other that there are no brokerage commissions or finders' fees due any party as a result of this transaction, except, however, that a commission (the "Gold Fee") is due Gold & Company in connection with a lease (the "EWI Lease") between Landlord and Executive Warehouse, Inc. dated _________________, 1996, with respect to approximately 515,375 square feet of space located in the balance of the Property. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for, and shall pay, a share of such Gold Fee as agreed upon by Tenant and Gold & Company.

Landlord and Tenant will indemnify and hold harmless each other for any breach of the above representations and warranties and agreements, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with any such claim. 5.9 Rights Cumulative. Unless expressly provided to the contrary in this Lease, each and every one of the rights, remedies and benefits provided by this Lease will be cumulative and will not be exclusive of any other such rights, remedies, and benefits allowed by law. 5.10 Non-Waiver. The failure of Landlord or Tenant to enforce against the other any provision, covenant or condition herein, by reason of either of them committing any breach of or default under this Lease, shall not be deemed a waiver thereof, nor shall such failure to enforce void or affect the right of the aggrieved party to enforce the same covenant or condition on the occasion of any subsequent breach or default; nor will the failure of either party to exercise any option in this Lease upon any occasion arising therefor be deemed or construed to be a waiver of the right to exercise the same type of option upon any subsequent occasion. 5.11 Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence in all provisions of this Lease. 5.12 Surrender of Premises. At the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term, Tenant will quit and surrender the Leased Premises, the Action Outside Area, all utility systems located in or servicing the Premises, the roof above the Leased Premises and every part of the Leased Premises in good operating condition and repair, reasonable wear and tear and damage by insured casualty excepted. 5.13 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Lease shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns unless prohibited by this Lease. 5.14 No Merger. There shall be no merger of this Lease or of the leasehold estate created by this Lease with the fee estate in the Property or any part of it because the same person or entity holds, directly or indirectly, this Lease or the leasehold estate and an interest in the fee estate in the Property, without the prior written consent of Landlord and Landlord's mortgagee. 5.15 Force Majeure. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, in the event either party hereto is delayed or hindered in, or prevented from, the performance of any act required hereunder by reason of strikes, lockouts, failure of power, restrictive governmental laws or regulations, riots, insurrection, war or other reasons of a like nature not the fault of the party delayed in performing work or doing acts required under the terms of this Lease (all of such reasons or causes referred to in this Lease as "force majeure"), then performance of such acts will be excused for the period of the delay, and the period of the performance of any such act will be extended for a period equivalent to the period of such delay, but in no event shall force majeure ever excuse Tenant from the obligation to pay Annual Rent, Tenant's Pro Rata Share of real estate taxes and assessments, insurance premiums, CAM Charges, Outside Common Area Expenses, additional rent or any other sum or charge when due. 5.16 Holdover. In the event Tenant fails to deliver possession of the Property then under lease by it by the last day of the Lease Term, this Lease shall be extended on a month-to-month basis until canceled by either party hereto by 30 days prior written notice. If Tenant fails to vacate the Property within 30 days after such notice by Landlord, Tenant shall be treated as a tenant at sufferance and shall pay as rent for the first two months of such holdover period an amount equal to 150% of the Annual Rent payable during the last Lease Year of the Lease Term and 200% of such rent for each month thereafter, and otherwise under the terms and conditions of this Lease. 5.17 Arbitration of CAM Charge Disputes. If, at any time, during the term of this Lease when the Premises includes at least 28,500 square feet, there arises any dispute relating to the items or amounts included in the calculation of Common Outside Area Expenses or CAM Charges and such dispute cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days after such dispute is asserted in writing, then either party to this Lease may, upon ten (10) days business notice to the other party, request arbitration and each party shall, within ten (10) business days thereafter, select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall then, within ten (10) business days thereafter, select a third arbitrator. If the two so selected cannot agree on a third, the third shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania or any successor organization thereto. The arbitration shall be held promptly in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania pursuant to the usual procedure of the American Arbitration Association. Such three (3) arbitrators shall investigate the allegations and the facts and shall promptly hold hearings and shall permit the parties to present evidence and arguments, and shall render a decision within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of such hearings as to the correct calculation of the amount of Common Outside Area Expenses or CAM Charges which were the subject of such proceeding, which decision shall be final, valid, binding, conclusive and non-appealable and any party shall have the right to institute such action or proceeding in such courts as shall be appropriate in the circumstances to enforce any such arbitration decision. The arbitrator shall determine which party or in what proportion the parties shall bear the cost of such arbitration and the manner in which attorneys' fees shall be paid. Any award of money damages and all costs and attorneys' fees payable hereunder shall be paid to the party entitled thereto within ten (10) days after the date it receives the arbitrations' decision. 5.18 Waiver of Jury Trial. LANDLORD AND TENANT WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR PROCEEDING BASED UPON, OR RELATED TO, THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LEASE. THIS WAIVER IS KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY MADE BY LANDLORD AND TENANT, AND LANDLORD AND TENANT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF SUCH PARTY HAS MADE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OF FACT TO INDUCE THIS WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY OR IN ANY WAY TO MODIFY OR NULLIFY ITS EFFECT. LANDLORD AND TENANT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EACH HAS BEEN REPRESENTED IN THE SIGNING OF THIS LEASE AND IN THE MAKING OF THIS WAIVER BY INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, SELECTED OF ITS OWN FREE WILL, AND THAT IT HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS WAIVER WITH COUNSEL. LANDLORD AND TENANT EACH FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS THE MEANING AND RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER PROVISION. 5.19 Landlord's Liability. (a) Tenant specifically agrees to look solely to the assets of Landlord at the time owned, for recovery of any judgment from Landlord; it being specifically agreed that John S. Karlton shall never be personally liable for any such judgment or for the payment of any monetary obligation to Tenant. (b) In no event shall Landlord ever be liable to Tenant for any loss of business or any other indirect or consequential damages suffered by Tenant from whatever cause. (c) With respect to any repairs, replacements or restoration which are required or permitted to be made by Landlord, the same may be made during normal business hours and Landlord shall have no liability for damages to Tenant for inconvenience, annoyance or interruption of business arising therefrom but, subject to the foregoing, Landlord will use reasonable efforts to minimize such inconvenience, annoyance or business interruption. 5.20 Assignment Of Rents And Transfer Of Title. (a) With reference to any assignment by Landlord of Landlord's interest in this Lease, or the rents payable hereunder, conditional in nature or otherwise, which assignment is made to the holder of a mortgage on property which includes the Leased Premises, Tenant agrees that the execution thereof by Landlord, and the acceptance thereof by the holder of such mortgage or assignment, shall not be treated as an assumption by such holder of any of the obligations of Landlord hereunder unless such holder shall specifically otherwise elect. (b) In the event of any transfer of title to the Property by Landlord, Landlord shall thereafter be entirely freed and relieved from the performance and observance of all covenants and obligations hereunder except for unperformed obligations arising out of events occurring prior to such transfer. 5.21 Quiet Enjoyment. If Tenant pays the Annual Rent, additional rent, CAM Charges, real estate taxes and assessments, insurance, Tenant's Outside Area Expenses and other sums and charges payable by Tenant hereunder and otherwise substantially performs all of the covenants and conditions to be performed by Tenant under this Lease, subject to applicable notice and grace periods, it shall, during the Lease Term, lawfully, peaceably and quietly occupy and enjoy the Leased Premises as provided herein with the improvements and appurtenances thereto belonging and the rights and privileges herein granted without hindrance or ejection by any persons lawfully claiming under Landlord to have title to the Leased Premises superior to Tenant. The foregoing covenant of quiet enjoyment is in lieu of any other covenant, express or implied. If a purchaser of the Property so requests, Tenant will attorn to and recognize the purchaser as Landlord under this Lease, subject to all of the terms of this Lease. 5.22 Estoppel Certificate. Upon request of Landlord or Tenant, the other party, within 10 days of the date of such written request, agrees to execute and deliver to the party requesting, without charge, a written statement (a) ratifying this Lease; (b) certifying that this Lease is in full force and effect, if such is the case, and has not been modified, assigned, supplemented, or amended except by such writings as are stated; (c) certifying that all conditions and agreements under this Lease to be satisfied and performed have been satisfied and performed, except as stated; (d) certifying that the other party is not in default under this Lease or stating the defaults claimed; and (e) reciting the amount of advance rental, if any, paid by Tenant and the date to which rental has been paid. 5.23 Emergency Cures.

Whenever under this Lease, express provision is made for either party's securing the consent or approval of the other, such consent or approval shall be in writing and shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as may be expressly set forth otherwise to the contrary. It is expressly understood and agreed that where a party has the right to grant or withhold approval in its sole discretion, the provisions of this Section 5.26 shall not apply. ARTICLE 6 - EFFECTIVE DATE; SPECIAL PROVISIONS 6.1 Effective Date. This Amended and Restated Lease shall become effective as of the date (the "Effective Date") upon which the term of the EWI Lease shall commence. Landlord shall give Tenant written notice of the date which is the actual commencement date of the EWI Lease when such date becomes fixed and established. Tenant shall, notwithstanding any term, covenant or provision of this Amended and Restated Lease to the contrary, remain liable for payment and performance of all obligations under the Existing Lease which accrue or are to be performed thereunder through the Effective Date and, also, for all obligations thereunder with respect to any matters occurring, arising or in existence through the Effective Date. Without limiting any other term or provision of this Lease, Tenant agrees that any and all purchase options, purchase rights, rights of first refusal and extension options in the Existing Lease are hereby terminated absolutely. 6.2 Surrender of Property. Tenant shall surrender the entire Property (exclusive of the Leased Premises under this Lease and subject to the Tenant's appurtenant rights to use the Action Outside Area) on the Effective Date in the condition required under, and in compliance with the provisions of, the Existing Lease. ARTICLE 7 - LANDLORD'S RIGHT TO TAKE BACK SPACE 7.1 Recapture Notice; Recapture Space; Annual Rent Adjustment. Landlord shall have the right (the "Recapture Right"), exercisable at any time, to terminate this Lease as to all or any part of the Premises by giving written notice to Tenant as provided herein (the "Recapture Notice"). Landlord may exercise the Recapture Right as often as Landlord may require from time to time and this Lease shall, as to such portion of the Premises as is included and specified in a Recapture Notice, terminate on the date set forth in any such Recapture Notice, which date shall be not sooner than twenty (20) days after the giving of such Notice, if the Recapture Notice relates to 30,000 square feet or less. If the Recapture Notice relates to more than 30,000 square feet, then the Termination Date in such Recapture Notice shall be the later of thirty (30) days after the giving of such Notice or December 31, 1996. In any such case, this Lease shall, as to the portion of the Premises included in any such Recapture Notice (such portion of the Premises being called the "Recapture Space"), expire and terminate on the date set forth in such Notice (but not sooner than the date specified in the immediately preceding sentences) with the same effect as if, as to such Recapture Space, the termination date set forth in the Recapture Notice were the expiration date of the Lease with respect to such Recapture Space. Upon the effective date of termination of this Lease by a Recapture Notice given under Article 7 hereof as to Recapture Space which constitutes less than all of the Premises, Tenant shall be entitled to a reduction in Annual Rent from and after the effective date of such termination in an amount equal to the greater of (a) the number of square feet so recaptured or terminated multiplied by the greater of $1.72 or (b) the actual annual fixed rent ("Recapture Space Fixed Rent") (exclusive of any additional rent on account of taxes, insurance, CAM charges and the like) payable under any lease (a "Recapture Space Lease") entered into by Landlord at such time or thereafter (but during what would have otherwise constituted a part of the five (5) year term of this Lease) with respect to Recapture Space allocable to any period which otherwise would have been coterminous with the balance of the te  rm of this Lease (but after deducting from such Recapture Space Fixed Rent, any portion thereof allocable to leasehold improvements paid for by Landlord for such new tenant and for leasing commissions, moving expense allowances, tenant inducements and other expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with such Recapture Space Lease, in each case, amortized over the term of such Recapture Space Lease). In no event shall Tenant be entitled to any excess rent (fixed or otherwise) which Landlord may receive on account of leasing Recapture Space which, in the aggregate, ever exceeds the Annual Rent hereunder, it being understood that at such time as Tenant's Annual Rent is reduced to zero as a result of reductions or credits which apply under this Section 17, whether as a result of leasing or releasing the Recapture Space or otherwise, then all of Tenant's rights to occupy any premises shall terminate effective as of such date (but not sooner than December 31, 1996). Effective upon the termination of this Lease as to any such Recapture Space, this Lease and Tenant's Pro Rata Share hereunder shall also be modified, effective as of such date in accordance with the formula set forth in Section 4.6 to take into account the reduction in the size of the Premises (except that Tenant's Pro Rata Share of Common Outside Area Expenses, as opposed to CAM Charges, shall be reduced ratably based on the percentage of space within the Premises which is, from time to time, recaptured (i.e. if 10% of the space is recaptured, then Tenant's original Pro Rata Share of Common Outside Area Expenses shall be reduced by 10%, i.e. 2.5%, to 22 1/2%). Tenant's share of utilities shall, if utilities for any Recaptured Space and Tenant's remaining space cannot be separately metered, be shared pro rata between Tenant and such new tenant in proportion to the total space occupied by each such tenant in relation to one and other. i.e. If Action's space is reduced by 40%, then effective upon the date when a new lease is entered into for such recaptured space, Tenant shall be responsible only for 60% of the submetered electricity for such space and 60% of gas, sewer and water utility charges related thereto unless, in any such case, Landlord elects to have such utilities submetered. The cost of any such submetering shall be borne by Tenant and, in such case, Tenant shall pay for utilities based on the submeter readings. Except that notwithstanding the provisions of this sentence to the contrary, if either Landlord or Tenant so requests, then the cost of electricity charges for electric service which commonly serves the Recaptured Space and any portion of the Premises then remaining under this Lease shall be determined by the utility company (or if the utility company will not do so, by an electrical engineer selected by Landlord) and Landlord shall have the right to periodically (not more often than once every six (6) months) have such share of electricity costs recalculated and re-estimated by the utility company or electrical engineer. Further, in the case of any other utility (except electricity) which commonly serves the Recaptured Space and the then remaining space included within the Premises under this Lease, either Landlord or Tenant shall have the right to have Tenant's share of such utilities determined by the utility company furnishing the same provided such utility company is willing to make such determination and, in such case, where the utility company makes such determination, Landlord shall have the right to have the utility company, from time to time, re-estimate the Tenant's share of such utilities but not more often than once during any six (6) month period. If either Landlord or Tenant elects to have an electrical engineer determine Tenant's electric usage or the utility company to determine any other utility usage of Tenant, then, until such time as the determination of such electrical engineer or utility company is made, Tenant shall pay its pro rata share of utilities on the basis otherwise herein stated and there shall be no readjustment for any period prior to the date when such a determination is made by such electrical engineer or utility company. 7.2. Upon exercise of any such Recapture Right, Tenant shall no longer have the exclusive right to use the Action Outside Area nor the parking spaces located therein as provided in Article 1 but, rather, shall, at the option of Landlord, either have the non-exclusive right to use the Action Outside Area in common with any such new tenant or tenants and, if Landlord so elects, Tenant's rights in the Action Outside Area insofar as it relates to parking shall be limited to the proportionate number of parking spaces located therein based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of square feet remaining within the Action Premises and the denominator of which is 57,925. Landlord shall have the right to designate exclusive parking areas and exclusive parking spaces for any such new tenant and shall have the right to restrict Action's parking spaces to a defined area within the Outside Common Area as Landlord may require. 7.3. As and to the extent required by Landlord, if access to any space of a new tenant which leases or occupies Recapture Space requires common access through any Premises which remain under this Lease, Action agrees to grant such common access and to fully cooperate with Landlord so that all necessary utilities and access are provided to such new space through any remaining premises under this Lease. If Landlord exercises a Recapture Right from time to time with respect to less than all the Premises then remaining under this Lease, the balance of space which does remain as Premises under this Lease after giving effect to such Recapture shall be space comprised of not less than 2,000 continuous square feet with access to and from such remaining space to an entrance outside the Building by any manner or means which Landlord may provide (including, without limitation, access through the space of another tenant). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that if Landlord so elects, Landlord could elect to recapture all of the Premises except the mezzanine area and provide Tenant with access from the mezzanine outside the Building through space leased to other tenants. 7.4 Landlord shall have the right in connection with the exercise of a Recapture Right to enter into the Premises or to permit its agents, contractors or subcontractors or any new tenant or their agents, their contractors or their subcontractors to enter into the Premises for the purpose of making such improvements and alterations as required in connection with such new lease but, in connection therewith, the parties agree to use good faith efforts to minimize interference with Tenant's use of any remaining space. 7.5 Upon request of either Landlord or Tenant, the parties shall enter into an amendment to this Lease consistent with the foregoing within fifteen (15) days after request by the other, although failure to do so shall not affect the operation of the provisions hereof, all of which shall operate automatically. Subject to Section 7.3, Landlord shall have the right to designate any parts of the Premises as Landlord may require for recapture pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph. 7.7 Any assignment of this Lease by Tenant and any subletting of all or any part of the Premises shall, in all cases, be subject to the rights of Landlord under this Article VII. 7.7 At Landlord's option, Landlord may assume all or any part of the responsibilities of Tenant under Section 4.7(a) of this Lease or may delegate such responsibility to any new tenant and, in any such case, Tenant shall be responsible for its pro rata share (such pro rata share to be based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the space remaining under this Lease and the denominator of which is 57,925 with all payments to be made to Landlord or its designee, as the case may be, on a monthly basis, based on Landlord's estimate of such costs with any overpayment or underpayment to be paid by the party responsible therefor within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Landlord's final statement in each fiscal year for the total costs for such year. Landlord may also elect to have Tenant continue to perform any or all of such obligations as they relate to the remaining space under this Lease if Landlord so elects. 7.8 Tenant agrees that it shall quit and surrender any Recapture Space in the condition required under the Lease not later than the effective termination date applicable thereto, time being of the essence. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Lease on the day and year first above written.

No repayment of the principal amount hereof shall be required prior to the "Maturity Date," defined as the earliest to occur of (a) the seventh anniversary of the date hereof, (b) the date when the Property or a majority interest in the Undersigned is sold to an unaffiliated third party (it being specifically understood that family members of John Karlton to the third degree of consanguinity and trusts created for his or their benefit are not unaffiliated third parties) or (c) the date when a refinancing of the indebtedness secured by the Property (a "Refinancing"), other than a First Refinancing (defined below), occurs. All outstanding principal, accrued interest and other amounts due hereunder shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. 4. If the Undersigned obtains a loan which refinances the mortgage loan currently owed to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("Metropolitan") which is secured by the Property (the "First Refinancing"), then such loan shall not have an original principal amount in excess of $10,800,000. An extension of the current Metropolitan loan shall not be considered to be the First Refinancing unless the principal amount of such loan is increased in connection with such extension; provided, that the inclusion of any fees, outstanding interest or similar amounts in the principal amount of such loan as a condition to such extension shall not constitute an increase in the principal amount of such loan for the purposes of this sentence. 5. Payments due under this Note and the obligations of the Undersigned hereunder are subject to setoff and deduction in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. 6. In the event of any litigation or arbitration between the Undersigned and Action, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred in connection with such litigation or arbitration.

Upon the occurrence of any of the events described below and so long as no Event of Default (as defined in the New Lease) which has been determined to have occurred under the New Lease has not been remedied, whether directly by Action or by the Partnership having the opportunity to exercise offset rights under the Settlement Agreement (each, an "Event of Default"), Action may, upon written notice to the Undersigned, declare this Note and all sums due hereunder to be immediately due and payable, whereupon such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by the Undersigned (except that upon the occurrence of any of the events described in clause (g) below, this Note and all sums due hereunder shall be immediately due and payable and without presentment, demand, protest or other formality of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by the Undersigned): (a) The Undersigned shall fail to make any payment of principal, interest or any other sums owing hereunder when due and such failure shall continue for more than ten (10) days after written notice thereof from Action to the Undersigned; (b) The Undersigned shall (i) default (as principal or as guarantor or other surety) in the payment or performance of any obligation for Indebtedness (as that term is defined in Section 8(f) of the Settlement Agreement) other than the Supplemental Note beyond any period of grace with respect thereto and (ii) in the case of the Indebtedness secured by a first mortgage lien on the Property from time to time only, the mortgagee commences to exercise any of its remedies with respect thereto; provided, however, that this Event of Default shall be deemed cured as and to the extent that the holder of such Indebtedness shall either waive the declaration of such default and reinstate the obligation or obligations or deem the obligation or obligations satisfied; and further provided, that notwithstanding any such default, Action will forbear from exercising its remedies hereunder for so long as the holders of all such Indebtedness so forbear, but if any of such holders charge interest at a penalty rate during the period of such forbearance then interest shall accrue hereunder during the period of such forbearance at the rate specified in Paragraph 7 above; (c) The Undersigned shall create, or permit to be created, voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, any mortgage, security interest or other lien of any kind upon any of its assets or properties, including without limitation upon the Property, the EWI Lease or the New Lease, except for (i) mortgages, security interests and assignments of leases and rents that secure the current Metropolitan loan or the loan obtained as a result of the First Refinancing (which shall in no event shall have a principal amount in excess of $10,800,000) and (ii) liens which are not voluntarily created or assented to by the Partnership and which are removed, bonded over or, in the case of materialmen's and mechanics' liens only, adequately reserved against within 30 days after written notice therof from Action to the Undersigned; provided, that the Undersigned shall not be deemed to be in default under this subparagraph if (A) such lien was created by an act or omission of a tenant of the Property and (B) the Undersigned is actively and in good faith pursuing its remedies against such tenant to have such lien removed or bonded over;

or (ii) seeking appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, liquidator, assignee, sequestrator or other similar official for the Undersigned or for all or any substantial party of its property and such proceeding shall result in the entry, making or grant of any such order for relief, declaration, finding, relief or appointment, or such proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a period of ninety consecutive days; provided, that any such proceeding shall not constitute a default under this subsection if Action institutes, or joins with any other creditor in instituting, such proceeding. 10.

POWER TO CONFESS JUDGMENT: AT ANY TIME AFTER AN EVENT OF DEFAULT DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH 9(a) HAS OCCURRED, THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AUTHORIZES AND EMPOWERS THE PROTHONOTARY OR ANY ATTORNEY OF ANY COURT OF RECORD WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE, INCLUDING THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF ALLEGHENY COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, TO APPEAR FOR THE UNDERSIGNED, AND WITH OR WITHOUT DECLARATION FILED, CONFESS JUDGMENT AGAINST THE UNDERSIGNED IN FAVOR OF THE HOLDER HEREOF, AS OF ANY TERM, FOR THE UNPAID BALANCE HEREOF, WHETHER BY ACCELERATION OR OTHERWISE WITH COSTS OF SUIT AND AN ATTORNEY'S COMMISSION OF $15,000 WITH RELEASE OF ERRORS. THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY WAIVES ALL LAWS EXEMPTING REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM EXECUTION, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS MAY LAWFULLY BE WAIVED BY THE UNDERSIGNED. NO SINGLE EXERCISE OF THE FOREGOING POWER TO CONFESS JUDGMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO EXHAUST THE POWER, WHETHER OR NOT ANY SUCH EXERCISE SHALL BE HELD BY ANY COURT TO BE INVALID, VOIDABLE OR VOID, BUT THE POWER SHALL CONTINUE UNDIMINISHED AND IT MAY BE EXERCISED FROM TIME TO TIME AS OFTEN AS THE HOLDER HEREOF SHALL ELECT, UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HOLDER SHALL HAVE RECEIVED PAYMENT IN FULL OF THE DEBT EVIDENCED HEREBY. BY SIGNING THIS INSTRUMENT, THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS NOTE IS GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH A COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION AND THAT IT HAS READ, UNDERSTOOD AND VOLUNTARILY AGREES TO THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED HEREIN, INCLUDING THE CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT PROVISION WHICH MAY RESULT IN A COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST THE UNDERSIGNED WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE OR HEARING AND SUBJECT TO ANY OFFSET RIGHTS OF THE UNDERSIGNED. 13. Action agrees that if, in connection with the enforcement of its rights under this Note, it obtains a lien against the Property, it will release such lien if (a) the Property is sold to EWI or its permitted assigns pursuant to the option, and at the option price, currently set forth in the EWI Lease and (b) Action receives all proceeds from such sale which are payable to the Landlord under the EWI Lease (but in no event more than are necessary to satisfy this Note and the Supplemental Note in full). 14. If at any time Action receives a bona fide offer to purchase this Note which it intends to accept, it shall give the Undersigned notice of such offer (an "Offer Notice"), which notice shall set forth the terms of such offer and the proposed purchaser. The Undersigned shall have a period of 10 days after its receipt of an Offer Notice to elect to purchase this Note on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Offer Notice (except the puchase price shall be paid in cash) by giving notice to Action to such effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the purchase price for this Note is payable in installments in whole or in part, then the Undersigned may either (a) pay the purchase price in cash, in which case the purchase price (or such portion thereof) shall be discounted to present value using the interest rate (if any) to be paid by such proposed purchaser or (b) pay the purchase price in installments, but only if it also delivers to Action an irrevocable letter of credit securing its obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price. If the Undersigned so elects to purchase this Note, then the closing of such transaction shall occur not later than the date when the closing with the proposed purchaser was to have occurred, as specified in the Offer Notice. If the Undersigned does not so elect to purchase this Note then, during the 90-day period commencing 10 days after the Undersigned's receipt of the Offer Notice, Action shall have the right to sell this Note to the purchaser identified in, and on terms and conditions substantially as specified in, the Offer Notice. If such a sale does not occur within such time period then it shall once again be subject to the terms of this Section. The foregoing rights of the Undersigned shall not be applicable in the case of a sale or other transfer of this Note to any person who controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Action or to any puchaser of all or substantially all of the assets of Action; provided, that the foregoing rights shall suvive any such sale or transfer and the transferee shall be bound thereby.

Intellectual Property shall be conveyed to Buyer by execution and delivery of an Assignment of Trademarks and Assignment of Trade Names and Copyrights in the forms attached hereto as Exhibits "B" and "C", respectively. (d) Right of Buyer to Exclude Certain Inventory. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary: (i) Buyer shall not be required to purchase any item of Powerhouse Inventory or Promotional Inventory which is not Good and Saleable Inventory; (ii) Buyer shall not be required to purchase any item of Powerhouse Inventory or Promotional Inventory if the total number of units in stock of such item on the Applicable Closing Date is less than one hundred (100); and (iii) Buyer shall not be required to purchase any new Inventory not presently in Seller's possession or on order or any Inventory purchased by Seller other than as specifically provided in or permitted under Section 6.1(b). Any Inventory which Buyer elects not to purchase pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) shall be deemed an Excluded Asset. 2.2 Excluded Assets. Buyer shall not purchase or acquire hereunder any right, title or interest in or to any of the properties, rights or assets of Seller not described in Section 2.1 hereof (collectively, the "Excluded Assets"). 2.3 Consideration. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in consideration for the Assets, Buyer shall pay and remit to Seller on the Applicable Closing Date the Purchase Price (as defined in Section 2.5(a) hereof) in the manner described in Section 2.4(b) hereof. 2.4 Inventory Taking. (a) On the day immediately preceding the Applicable Closing Date, a "wall-to-wall" physical inventory of the Inventory to be purchased on such date will be conducted at the Warehouse Facilities and, if applicable, at the Cheswick Facility, by Seller and by Buyer jointly at their respective cost and expense. Such inventory will be valued at 63.3% of actual cost of Inventory, as reflected in Seller's books and records (as previously reviewed by Buyer). Procedures for the taking and calculation of the Inventory are set forth in Exhibit "D" attached hereto and made a part hereof. The parties shall agree upon and sign the report of the Inventory ("Inventory Report") following the completion of the physical inventory and the resolution of any disputes. In order to facilitate the taking of the "wall-to-wall" physical inventory: (i) all operations of Seller at the facility at which the Inventory to be purchased is located shall cease during the taking of such physical inventory; and (ii) no such Inventory shall be shipped and no goods or materials shall be received during the taking of such physical inventory. Representatives of Buyer and Seller shall be entitled to participate at their respective cost and expense in the observation of the physical inventory. (b) In the event of a dispute between the parties as to the accuracy of any items contained in the Inventory Report, then the Buyer shall pay the undisputed amount to the Seller on the Applicable Closing Date and Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in order to agree upon the proper valuation. If they shall fail to come to an agreement with respect thereto within fifteen (15) days after such negotiation shall commence, then the amount of the Inventory valuation shall be referred for determination to the Cleveland, Ohio offices of Deloitte & Touche (the "Dispute Accountants"), who shall be instructed, with respect to each item in dispute, to choose between the position taken on that issue by Buyer and the position taken on that issue by Seller (as opposed to adopting either a compromise position or any position not taken by one or the other of Buyer and Seller). The Dispute Accountants shall have no right, authority or discretion to employ any accounting standard or principles or valuation method except for those reflected in "Exhibit D". The determination by the Dispute Accountants shall be final, binding, and conclusive on the parties. The fees and disbursements of the Dispute Accountants shall be allocated between Buyer and Seller so that the dollar amount of such fees and disbursements borne by each of them is in direct proportion to that portion of the dollar amount of the items in dispute (i.e.: the aggregate dollar spread between the positions taken by each of Buyer and Seller) with respect to which the Dispute Accountants find against each of Buyer and Seller, respectively. Nothing herein contained shall be construed (i) to authorize or permit the Dispute Accountants to arbitrate or determine any question or matter whatsoever under or in connection with this Agreement except the valuation of inventory, or (ii) to require the Dispute Accountants to follow rules of the American Arbitration Association or of any other body in making such determination. 2.5 Purchase Price and Payment. (a) The aggregate purchase price for the Assets (the "Purchase Price") will be an amount equal to (i) $100,000 plus (ii) an amount equal to 63.3% of Seller's actual cost of the Inventory plus (iii) an amount equal to five percent (5%) of Gross Sales of Powerhouse Inventory. It is the present intention of Buyer to sell Powerhouse Inventory to the Powerhouse Customers from the Columbus Warehouse. (b) The Purchase Price will be paid as follows: (i) On the First Closing Date, Buyer shall pay the sum of $25,000 plus an amount equal to 63.3% of Seller's actual cost of Powerhouse Inventory; (ii) On the Second Closing Date, Buyer shall pay the sum of $75,000 plus an amount equal to 63.3% of Seller's actual cost of the Promotional Inventory; and (iii) Within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the First Closing Date, Buyer shall make the payment described in subsection 2.5(a)(iii) above (such payment shall accompanied by a sales report indicating Gross Sales upon which such payment is based, together with such additional documentation as Seller may reasonably require). Any dispute between the parties with respect to the calculation or payment of the royalties described in subsection 2.5(a)(iii) which remains unresolved for a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which notice of such dispute is received by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall be referred to the Dispute Accountants for determination in accordance with Section 2.4(b), and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. (c)(i) To the extent that the Purchase Price for the Assets paid on the First Closing Date or Second Closing Date is greater than the purchase price for the Assets sold on such Applicable Closing Date, as finally determined, such excess resulting from breakage of or damage to perishable or fragile container Inventory that is discovered within thirty (30) days following the Applicable Closing Date and which renders such Inventory non-saleable (such excess payment being hereinafter referred to as the "Adjustment"), Buyer may, at its sole election and upon notice to Seller, set off against the royalty payments described in subparagraph 2.5(b)(iii) an amount equal to such excess payment. Any notice delivered by Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence shall set forth in reasonable detail the type, unit quantity and cost to Buyer of each item of Inventory in respect of which an adjustment is being claimed by Buyer. In the event such setoff is insufficient to satisfy any Purchase Price Adjustment in Buyer's favor, Seller shall pay to Buyer by certified check or by wire transfer in immediately available federal funds, the amount of the deficiency plus interest thereon from the Applicable Closing Date at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum. Notwithstanding anything in this subsection to the contrary, Buyer shall not be entitled to claim any Adjustment in its favor unless, and solely to the extent, the total Purchase Price paid for the damaged or broken container Inventory in respect of which the Adjustment is being claimed, exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price paid on the Applicable Closing Date; (ii) To the extent the Purchase Price for the Assets, sold on the First Closing Date or Second Closing Date, as finally determined, is greater than the purchase price paid on the Applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by certified check or by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds, an amount equal to such difference plus interest thereon from the Applicable Closing Date at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum. 2.6 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price represents the amount agreed upon by the parties to be the fair market value of the Assets. The Purchase Price shall be allocated for income tax purposes among the Assets in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code. Buyer shall provide to Seller, not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined, a written proposal for the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Assets. Seller shall notify Buyer within thirty (30) days of receipt of the proposal whether or not and to what extent Seller agrees with the proposal. If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on the allocation within forty-five (45) days of Seller's receipt of the proposal, each of Buyer and Seller shall be free to allocate the Purchase Price among the Assets as it may independently deem appropriate. If, however, Buyer and Seller agree upon the allocation, each of the parties hereby covenants and agrees that it will not take a position on any federal, state or local tax return before any governmental agency charged with the collection of any tax, or in any judicial proceeding that is in any way inconsistent with the purchase price allocation and will cooperate with one another in the timely filing consistent with such purchase price allocation on Form 8594 with the Internal Revenue Service. 2.7 No Assumption of Liabilities. (a) Buyer and Seller agree that Buyer is not purchasing, assuming, or accepting any debts, liabilities or obligations whatsoever of Seller, contingent or non-contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, asserted or unasserted, all of which remain the debts, liabilities, and obligations of Seller, except as provided in Section 2.7(b) hereof. (b) On the Applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall assume and agree to pay, perform and discharge the following (and only the following) obligations of Seller (collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities"): (i) such customer purchase orders for Powerhouse Inventory and Promotional Inventory accepted by Seller in the ordinary course of business (to the extent the same remain unfulfilled on the Applicable Closing Date) as Buyer shall review, approve and elect in writing to assume in its sole and absolute discretion; and (ii) such other contracts, obligations and commitments of Seller in respect of the Inventory as Buyer shall review, approve and elect in writing to assume in its sole and absolute discretion. 2.8 Unassumed Liabilities. Buyer shall not assume or be liable to Seller or any other person or entity for or in respect of any debts, liabilities and obligations of Seller not specified in Section 2.7 hereof (collectively, the "Unassumed Liabilities"). Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7 hereof and without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Buyer shall not assume or be liable to Seller or any other person or entity for or in respect of the following debts, liabilities and obligations of Seller: (a) Any debt, liability or obligation of Seller to taxing or other governmental authorities for any foreign or domestic, federal, state or local income taxes or similar taxes based upon the income of Seller for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (b) Any debt, liability or obligation with respect to any event which shall have occurred on or prior to the Closing Date whether or not such event and the liability relating thereto is insured against under any of the coverages under the insurance policies and/or self-insurance programs of Seller; (c) Any debt, liability or obligation of Seller under or in respect of any compensation or benefit plan, policy or arrangement in favor of the Employees of Seller; (d) Any debt, liability or obligation of Seller to any of its shareholders, directors, officers or Employees arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, any liability for severance or termination pay; (e) Any of Seller's products liability obligations or product warranty obligations; or (f) Any debt, liability or obligation of Seller arising from or relating to, directly or indirectly, of Seller's employee welfare plans or employee benefit plans. 2.9 Bulk Sale Law. The parties hereto understand and agree that the transfer which is the subject matter of this Agreement may be subject to the provisions of Chapter 1306 of the Ohio Revised Code, Uniform Commercial Code (Bulk Transfers) ["Bulk Sales Law"] and that Buyer is not assuming any debts or obligations of Seller in connection with this Agreement in its sole discretion, except for such unfilled customer purchase orders and other agreements or obligations as Buyer may elect to assume pursuant to subparagraphs 2.7(b)(i) and (ii). Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the Bulk Sales Law solely with respect to the transactions to be consummated on the First Closing Date; provided, however, that such waiver does not as between Buyer and Seller relieve Seller of any of the Unassumed Liabilities. Seller agrees to furnish in adequate time to comply with the Bulk Sales Law affidavits, list of creditors with addresses and such other instruments and documents as are customary pursuant to the Bulk Sales Law as Buyer's counsel shall require for Buyer to comply with the Bulk Sales Law with respect to the transactions to be consummated on the Second Closing Date. Forms of the Bulk Sales Notice and Bulk Sales Affidavit are attached hereto as Exhibits "E" and "F", respectively. 2.10 Non-Assignable Contracts and Rights. To the extent that the assignment by Seller of any property, right or asset to be assigned to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall require the consent or approval of any other party, and such consent or approval shall not have been obtained on or prior to the Applicable Closing Date, this Agreement shall not constitute a contract to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller (or Buyer as assignee) thereunder. In such case, the beneficial interest in or to such property, right or asset shall in any event pass as of the Closing Date to Buyer hereunder, and Seller covenants and agrees: (a) From and after the Applicable Closing Date to hold and declare that Seller holds any and all such properties, rights or assets in trust for the benefit of Buyer and its successors and assigns; (b) To use their reasonable best efforts to obtain and secure any and all consents and approvals that may be necessary to effect the valid sale, transfer or assignment of the same to Buyer without change in any of the material terms or conditions thereof, including, without limitation, the formal assignment or novation of any of the same, if so required; (c) To make or complete such transfers as soon as reasonably possible; (d) To cooperate with Buyer in any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide for Buyer the benefits of and to such properties, rights or assets; and (e) From and after the Applicable Closing Date to use reasonable efforts, at the request and expense of Seller, to enforce for the account of Buyer (and its successors and assigns) any and all rights of Seller arising from or in respect of such properties, rights or assets. 2.11 Prorations.

Any net amount owed hereunder shall be paid within thirty (30) days following the Applicable Closing Date by the party owing such amount or within thirty (30) days after the date of determination, if later.

In the event a party is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand or similar process) to disclose any confidential information, such party agrees to provide the other party with prompt notice of such request so that the other party may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive such party's compliance with the provisions of this paragraph. The foregoing shall not prevent either party from making such disclosures as are in the reasonable judgment of such party's counsel, required by applicable securities laws, except that each party shall advise the other party in writing and, to the fullest extent practicable, will consult with the other prior to making any such disclosure. Upon termination of this Agreement, for whatever reason, prior to the Second Closing Date, Buyer agrees to deliver to Seller all written materials, reports and information (including Trade Secrets) furnished by Seller concurrently with or prior to the execution of this Agreement (except for Assets purchased by Buyer on the First Closing Date), and Buyer will destroy all copies of same. (b) Non-Competition. Seller agrees that commencing on the First Closing Date and for a period expiring five (5) years following the First Closing Date (if the First Closing occurs but the Second Closing fails to occur) or expiring five (5) years following the Second Closing Date (if the Second Close Date occurs) (the "Restricted Period"), Seller will not, directly or indirectly, either as principal, agent, partner, lender, investor, or in any other capacity, engage in, have a financial interest in or be in any way connected or affiliated with any enterprise (whether or not incorporated) which engages in the purchase, sale, marketing, import, distribution or brokerage of replenishment inventory or promotional inventory of a format, category or product line which is sold or offered for sale by Seller in the United States of America at the date of this Agreement ("Competitive Products"), except for the sale of Promotional Inventory pending the Second Closing Date, and except for Inventory included in the Excluded Assets. In addition, Seller will not, during the Restricted Period, divert or take away or attempt to divert or take away any of Buyer's or any Buyer's affiliates' employees and, solely with respect to the Competitive Products and Competitive Business (defined below), Buyer's or Buyer's affiliates' customers or suppliers, and, further, Seller shall refrain from, directly or indirectly: (i) committing any act which would in any way jeopardize any relationship Buyer or any Buyer affiliate has or may come to have with any such employee, customer or supplier; or (ii) engaging in, having a financial interest in, or being in any way connected or affiliated with any enterprise which engages in the wholesale or retail sale and distribution of closeout merchandise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the above paragraph, in the event the Second Closing does not occur solely as a result of Buyer's breach of its obligations hereunder (as finally determined by a court of law), the covenants contained in Paragraph 9.3(b) shall be inoperative and of no force and effect. (c) Injunctive Relief. Seller and Buyer agree that the remedy at law for any breach by them of the foregoing provisions of this section will be inadequate, and Buyer shall be entitled to both temporary and permanent injunctive relief (without bond) enforcing such provisions, in addition to any other remedy it may have at law or in equity. 9.4 Negotiation with Others. From and after the date hereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11, or (ii) December 31, 1996, neither Seller nor any of Seller's officers, directors, employees or agents will, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit or initiate discussions or engage in negotiations with any person (whether such negotiations are initiated by them or otherwise), other than Buyer, with respect to the possible acquisition of the Assets or any portion thereof, (b) provide any information with respect to the Assets to any person, other than Buyer, relating to the possible acquisition of the Assets or any portion thereof, or (c) enter into a transaction with any person, other than Buyer, concerning the possible acquisition of the Assets or any portion thereof . Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to prevent sales to customers prior to the Applicable Closing Date in the ordinary course of business. If Seller or any of Seller's officers, directors, employees or agents receives any unsolicited offer or proposal to enter into negotiations relating to any of the above, Seller shall immediately notify Buyer of such fact. 9.5 Replenishment Sales Following First Closing Date. Except for the payments described in Section 2.5(a), any sales of Powerhouse Inventory by Buyer at any time following the First Closing Date for replenishment of goods originally ordered by a Powerhouse Customer or a Promotional Customer prior to the First Closing Date, which replenishment request is filled by Buyer, shall be for the sole account of Buyer (it being understood, however, that Buyer shall not be obligated to fill any such replenishment order). 9.6 Approval of Shareholders of Seller. Seller will use its best efforts to obtain the approval of its shareholders the execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions described herein. Seller represents and warrants that it is not aware of any reason why shareholder consent and approval will not be obtained by December 31, 1996. 9.7 Right of First Refusal with Respect to Other Assets of Seller. Unless the First Closing Date does not occur solely by reason of Buyer's default or breach hereunder, in the event Seller receives an offer for all or a significant portion of its assets other than the Assets at any time within thirty (30) days following the First Closing Date (such other assets may include, but are not limited to, warehouse and office fixture and equipment, electronic and computer equipment, and transferable software), Buyer shall have a right of first refusal to acquire all or any portion of such assets upon the same terms and conditions as offered by the third party. Seller shall promptly furnish Buyer with a complete description of the terms and conditions of such offer, including the purchase price, the terms and conditions of purchase, the proposed Closing Date, and the identity of the Purchaser. In addition to the foregoing, in the event the First Closing occurs but the Second Closing does not occur (other than solely by reason of Buyer's default or breach under this Agreement), Buyer shall have a right of first refusal to purchase any Intellectual Property which is not conveyed to Buyer at the First Closing upon the same terms and conditions as offered by a third party at any time prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary of the First Closing Date, and Seller shall furnish a copy of the third party offer containing the same detail as prescribed in the preceding sentence. Buyer shall notify Seller in writing within twenty (20) days following receipt of the third party offer ("Notice of Exercise") whether Buyer desires to exercise its rights of refusal hereunder, and the purchase and sale of assets under this Section shall occur on the later of the closing date described in the third party offer or thirty (30) days following the date of Buyer's Notice of Exercise. 9.8 Trade Show Deposits. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has heretofore provided to Buyer written evidence of payment by Seller of deposits (collectively, "Trade Show Deposits") for floor space for show booths for the following trade conventions: (i) National Housewares Merchants Association (NHMA), McCormick Place, Chicago, Illinois (to be held January 1997) - $12,375.00, and (ii) Association of Retail Marketing Services (ARMS), Ramada Congress Hotel, Chicago, Illinois (to be held January 1997) - such amounts as have been paid by the Second Closing Date, not to exceed $2,360 (collectively, the "Trade Show Deposits"). On the Second Closing Date, Buyer will pay to Seller an amount equal to the Trade Show Deposit pertaining to such convention trade show, and shall assume Seller's remaining payment obligations, if any, in respect of the ARMS convention. Seller represents and warrants that its floor space for trade show booth for the NHMA Trade Show has been paid in full. 9.9 Accounts Receivable. The parties acknowledge that Buyer is not acquiring any of Seller's accounts receivable. Any payments received by Buyer in respect of Seller's receivables shall be allocated in accordance with the customer's designation; absent such designation, such payments shall be allocated and paid first to Seller to the extent of the unpaid balance owed by such customer to Seller for goods shipped and billed prior to the applicable Closing Date. Each party agrees to properly remit to the other, in precisely the form received, with endorsement, any and all payments received by such party which payment is actually due and owing to the other party, and any such sums erroneously paid by the customer to such party shall be held in trust for the other party. Each party agrees to furnish the other access to deposit slips, bank reconciliation statements, customer correspondence and other documents upon the reasonable request of such other party in order to verify the prompt remittance of all sums required to be remitted to the other party pursuant to this Section 9.9. SECTION 10 RISK OF LOSS 10.1 Risk of Loss. Risk of Loss with respect to the Assets being transferred on an Applicable Closing Date shall pass to Buyer effective as of the opening of business on such Applicable Closing Date. SECTION 11 TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT 11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated forthwith upon the receipt of notice of termination as provided for in Section 11.2 hereof, and the purchase and sale and the other transactions provided for by this Agreement may be abandoned, without liability on the party of either party to the other, except as otherwise provided in Section 14.1(b): (a) By mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer; (b) By Buyer, if any of the conditions of Section 7 of this Agreement have not been satisfied on the intended Closing Date and have not been waived by Buyer in writing; (c) By Seller, if any of the conditions of Section 8 of this Agreement have not been satisfied on the intended Applicable Closing Date and have not been waived by Seller in writing; (d) By either Buyer or Seller, if the Second Closing Date has not occurred (for any reason other than a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or in any Schedule or Exhibit hereto by the party seeking to so terminate) on or before January 31, 1997; or (e) By either Buyer or Seller, if the other party files on or before the Second Closing Date a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership or a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership is filed on or before the Second Closing Date against such other party. 11.2 Notice of Termination. In the event of termination and abandonment by either party as provided in Section 11.1 hereof, prompt written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party. SECTION 12 INDEMNIFICATION AND REIMBURSEMENT 12.1 Indemnification by Seller. (a) In order to induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to consummate transactions contemplated hereby, Seller covenants and agrees to and shall indemnify Buyer and its partners (and their constituent partners and shareholders), officers, employees and agents, and their heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Interests") and shall hold the Buyer Interests harmless against and with respect to any and all Damages incurred in connection with or arising out of or resulting from or incident to: (i) any misrepresentation, omission, breach of warranty, representation or covenant, or non-fulfillment of any obligation on the part of Seller under this Agreement, any certificate, Schedule or Exhibit, or other instrument furnished to Buyer in connection with this Agreement; (ii) the Unassumed Liabilities; (iii) Seller's failure to comply with the provisions of the Bulk Sales Law; (iv) any claims, violations or alleged violations by Seller of any laws, statutes, codes, ordinances, rules or regulations whether foreign or domestic, state, federal or local; (v) the filing (or failure to file) or payment (or non-payment) of any taxes by Seller, pursuant to any federal, state, local or foreign income tax, excise or franchise tax, ad valorem, sales and use tax, payroll tax, and/or F.I.C.A. taxes or any deficiencies in any taxes payable by or on behalf of Seller; (vi) arising from or relating to any and all claims, grievances or arbitrations under any collective bargaining agreement to which Seller may have been a party at any time prior to the Closing Date, including, but not limited to, claims and/or judgments for unfair labor practices incurred on or limited to, before the Closing Date whether filed (by either union or non-union employees) prior to, on, or after the Closing Date with the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable federal, state or local board, agency, or commission, or any state or federal court; (vii) any damages, obligation or penalty for contributions to any Plan with respect to Seller's employees for all periods on and before the Closing Date, ERISA claims or violations; (viii) any and all amounts owed by Seller to Bank or to Transmanagement Corporation; (ix) any liability related to any Excluded Asset; and (x) any and all actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, penalties, fines, judgments, costs and legal and other expenses incident to any of the foregoing. (b) The indemnification of this Section shall survive the Closing; provided, however, that any claim for the incorrectness or breach of the representations, warranties or covenants of Seller contained in Section 4 must be brought within the applicable limitations period as described in Section 4.26. 12.2 Indemnification by Buyer. (a) In order to induce Seller to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer covenants and agrees to and shall indemnify Seller, its directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Interests") and shall hold the Seller Interests harmless against and with respect to any and all Damages, incurred in connection with or arising out of or resulting from or incident to: (i) a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the party of Buyer under this Agreement or under any document executed and delivered by Buyer in connection therewith; (ii) the failure of Buyer to pay or perform any of the Assumed Liabilities; (iii) the conduct by Buyer of its business following the Closing Date; and (iv) any and all actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, penalties, fines, judgments, costs and legal and other expenses incident to any of the foregoing. (b) The indemnification in this Section shall survive the Closing. 12.3 Product Liability Matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the provisions of this Section 12 shall apply to any Damages claimed under Section 12.1(a)(ii) or Section 12.2(a)(ii) or (iii) which directly result from any product liability claims, suits, demands or causes of action arising following the Applicable Closing Date and that pertain to any of the Inventory. With respect to such matters, the parties do not intend for this Agreement to alter the legal relationship between them that would exist in the absence of this Agreement. 12.4 Claims for Reimbursement. In the event that the Buyer Interests or the Seller Interests shall have suffered any Damages (as hereinabove defined) with respect to any liability or claim to which the foregoing indemnities relate, the Buyer Interests or the Seller Interests, as the case may be (the "Indemnified Party"), shall give Seller or Buyer, as the case may be (the "Indemnifying Party"), prompt written notice of the nature and amount of such Damages and the Indemnified Party's claim for reimbursement therefor. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the date of said notice to investigate and dispute the nature, validity or amount of any such claim. During said 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon prior notice, to the books and records of the Indemnified Party for the purpose of such investigation in accordance with the provisions of Sections 12.1 or 12.2 hereof. In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall dispute the nature, validity or amount of said claim, the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party written notice of such dispute within said 30-day period, and the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute. In the absence of a dispute, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and in any event not later than the expiration of said 30-day period, reimburse the Indemnified Party in full for any such Damages, as set forth in the Indemnified Party's notice. In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall dispute only the amount of the claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, concurrently with the delivery of its notice of dispute, pay to the Indemnified Party the undisputed portion of the claim. 12.5 Defense of Third-Party Claims. If any lawsuit or enforcement action is filed against an Indemnified Party by a third party and the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, written notice thereof shall be given to the Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) days after the service of the citation or summons); provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates actual damages caused by such failure, if (i) such failure to give timely notice does not materially affect the ability or right of the Indemnifying Party to participate in the defense of such lawsuit or enforcement action, (ii) actual notice is given to the Indemnifying Party within a reasonable time, and (iii) to the extent that such failure to give timely notice causes the Indemnifying Party to incur additional expense with respect to such lawsuit or enforcement action, the Indemnified Party promptly reimburses the Indemnifying Party for such additional expense. After such notice, if the Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge in writing to such Indemnified Party that such Indemnifying Party may be obligated under the terms of its indemnity hereunder in connection with such lawsuit or action, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, if it so elects, to take control of the defense and investigation of such lawsuit or action, and to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice to handle and defend the same, at the Indemnifying Party's cost, risk and expense; and such Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects, at its cost, risk and expense, with the Indemnifying Party and such attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action any appeal arising therefrom. 12.6 Indemnification as Sole Remedy; Exceptions. Absent fraud on the part of Seller, and subject to Section 14.1(b), the indemnification provided to Buyer in this Agreement shall be the sole remedy of Buyer against Seller in respect of any claims arising under or out of this Agreement or any of the documents delivered on the Applicable Closing Date that are based upon any action, fact or circumstance existing as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that should Buyer assert a claim for indemnification between the First Closing Date and Second Closing Date, Buyer, upon notice to Seller, and to the extent that Seller does not dispute said claim in writing within five (5) days following receipt thereof, may satisfy such indemnification claim by setting off the amount of such claim against its payment obligations on the Second Closing Date. Should Seller dispute said claim, or a portion of said claim, in writing, Buyer shall deposit the disputed portion of the claim in a joint signature interest- bearing escrow account pending full and final resolution of the claim (costs of escrow to be paid or reimbursed by the non-prevailing party). Subject to Section 14.1(b), the indemnification provided to Seller in this Section 12 shall be the sole remedy of Seller against Buyer against Buyer in respect of any claims arising under or out of this Agreement or any of the documents delivered on the Applicable Closing Date that are based upon any action, fact or circumstance existing as of the date of this Agreement. 12.7 Limitations. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, absent fraud on the part of Seller: (i) the indemnification obligations of Seller pursuant to this Section 12 shall in no event exceed the aggregate Purchase Price; (ii) should the First Closing occur but the Second Closing fail to occur, for whatever reason, neither party shall be required to indemnify the other pursuant to this Section 12 except in the event that the aggregate amount of Damages suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Party exceeds Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000), whereupon the Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the Indemnified Party for the full extent of such Damages (including the first Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000)); and (iii) should the Second Closing occur, neither party shall be required to indemnify the other pursuant to this Section 12 except in the event that the aggregate amount of Damages suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Party exceeds Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000), whereupon the Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the Indemnified Party for the full extent of such Damages (including the first Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000)). SECTION 13 RIGHT TO PROCEED 13.1 Waiver of Conditions. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if any of the conditions specified in Section 7 hereof have not been satisfied, Buyer shall have the right to waive one or more conditions precedent and proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby without waiving any of its other rights hereunder, and if any of the conditions specified in Section 8 hereof have not been satisfied, Seller shall have the right to waive one or more conditions precedent and proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby without waiving any of its other rights hereunder; provided, however, that if a party shall so elect to proceed, such party shall not thereafter attempt to hold the other party responsible for Damages resulting from the condition or conditions waived and such other party shall not be responsible for such Damages. SECTION 14 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 14.1 Costs and Expenses. (a) Each party covenants and agrees that it shall be responsible for and bear its respective costs and expenses in connection with, or arising out of, the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions provided for herein; provided, however, that Seller shall bear and be responsible for any and all sales or transfer taxes applicable to the transfer of Assets provided for herein. (b) In the event any or all of the transactions described in this Agreement fail to close in accordance with the terms hereof because Seller is in default hereunder or has failed to obtain director or shareholder approval or any other required consent and provided Buyer is not in default hereunder, Seller shall pay to Buyer, as liquidated damages, within three (3) days following demand by Buyer, the amount of $150,000, the parties having attempted in good faith to ascertain the damages which will result should the transactions fail to close other than due to the fault or breach of Buyer, and said sum represents the parties' best efforts to estimate such damage. In the event any or all of the transactions described in this Agreement fail to close in accordance with the terms hereof, and such failure is due solely to the breach by Buyer of its obligations hereunder or because any of the conditions described in Sections 8.1 through 8.7 have not been satisfied or waived in writing by Seller, Buyer shall pay to Seller, as liquidated damages, immediately upon demand by Seller the amount of $100,000, the parties having attempted in good faith to ascertain the damages which will result should the transactions fail to close due solely to the fault or breach of Buyer, and said sum represents the parties' best efforts to estimate such damage. (c) Seller agrees that should Seller fail to pay in full to Buyer as liquidated damages the sum of $150,000 within three (3) days following demand by Buyer as required pursuant to the first sentence of Section 14.1(b), Buyer may, at its sole election and upon notice to Seller, satisfy such payment obligations of Seller by selecting, removing and retaining for Buyer's own account for no additional consideration, such Promotional Inventory of Seller as remains on hand and which Buyer desires to acquire, having a purchase price (calculated in accordance with Section 2.5(b)) equal to (x) $150,000 less (y) the amount of liquidated damages actually paid by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 14.1(b). Buyer agrees that, should it elect to satisfy Seller's payment obligations under Section 14.1(b) by selecting and retaining for its account Promotional Inventory (subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Paragraph 14.1(c)), Buyer shall, prior to selecting such Inventory, satisfy Seller's liquidated damages payment obligation by setting off such amount, to the fullest extent possible, against its royalty payment obligations (described in Section 2.5(a)(iii)) then due and owing to Seller. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer and shall use its best efforts to cause Bank and others to cooperate with Buyer, in all reasonable respects in connection with Buyer's selection, removal and transport of Promotional Inventory pursuant to this Section 14.1(c). 14.2 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only in writing executed by each of the parties hereto. 14.3 No Assignment. No party hereto shall assign, in whole or in part, this Agreement or its respective rights and obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, and, absent such consent, any assignment (including, without limitation, any assignment by merger, death, dissolution or operation of law) shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to Mazel Stores, Inc., an Ohio corporation, without the consent of Seller; provided, that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder. 14.4 Notices. All notices, requests, demands or other communications hereunder must be in writing executed by an authorized representative of the party responsible therefor, and must be given either by hand or telex, telecopy, telefax or other telecommunications device capable of creating a written record (confirmed by registered or certified mail or by overnight courier) (i) if to Buyer, to: Mazel Company L.P., 31200 Aurora Road, Solon, Ohio 44139 (telecopier number (216) 349-1543, Attention: Reuven Dessler, Chairman) or to such other person or place as Buyer shall furnish to Seller in writing, with a copy to Bennett Yanowitz, Esq., Kahn, Kleinman, Yanowitz & Arnson Co., L.P.A., 2600 Tower at Erieview, Cleveland, Ohio 44114 or (ii) if to Seller to: Action Industries, Inc., 460 Nixon Road, Cheswick, Pennsylvania 15024 (telecopier number (412) 782-8606, Attention: T. Ronald Casper, President) or to such other person or place as Seller shall furnish to Buyer in writing, with a copy to Daniel Wessels, Esq., Cohen & Grigsby, P.C., 2900 CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-3115 (telecopier number (412) 391-3382). 14.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. 14.6 Headings. Section and paragraph headings in this Agreement are provided for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part hereof. 14.7 Recitals, Exhibits and Schedules. The recitals contained at the beginning of this Agreement and all Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto shall be deemed an integral part of this Agreement and shall be incorporated herein by reference. 14.8 Schedules and Exhibits. Any Schedules and Exhibits which are to be attached hereto at Closing, updated as of the Closing Date or delivered separately upon execution hereof or on the Closing Date shall be initialed by the parties hereto and shall be deemed delivered under this Agreement. 14.9 Waiver; Remedies. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other subsequent breach, and the failure of a party to enforce at any time any provision hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of any right of such party to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision hereof. All remedies afforded in this Agreement shall be taken and construed as cumulative, that is, in addition to every other remedy provided herein or by law. 14.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and applicable federal law. 14.11 Jurisdiction and Venue. Both parties agree that in the event that any lawsuit is filed by one of them against the other in connection with any matter arising from or connected with this Agreement, any related agreement, and/or the transactions contemplated hereby, such lawsuit shall be filed exclusively in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, or the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania or the Court of Common Pleas for Cuyahoga County, Ohio or for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (at the election of the party filing suit) and each party covenants and agrees that it shall voluntarily consent and irrevocably submit to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of said courts. 14.12 Severability. In the event that any provision or any portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. 14.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the ancillary documents executed hereunder set forth the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions provided for herein and supersede and cancel any and all prior discussions, correspondence, agreements or understandings (whether oral or written) between the parties hereto with respect to such matters (including, but not limited to, the Summary of Preliminary Terms and Conditions dated August 30, 1996). 14.13 Time is of the Essence.
