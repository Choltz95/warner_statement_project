Item 1. Business The Registrant, Albertson's, Inc. ("Albertson's" or the "Company"), is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is the successor to a business founded by J. A. Albertson in 1939. On June 23, 1999, Albertson's, Inc. ("Albertson's" or the "Company") and American Stores Company ("ASC") consummated a merger with the issuance of 177 million shares of Albertson's common stock (the "Merger"). The Merger constituted a tax-free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The pooling of interests method of accounting is intended to present, as a single interest, two or more common stockholders' interests that were previously independent; accordingly, these consolidated financial statements restate the historical financial statements as though the companies had always been combined. The restated consolidated financial statements are adjusted to conform accounting policies and financial statement presentations. In connection with the Merger, the Company entered into agreements with the Attorneys General of California, Nevada and New Mexico and the Federal Trade Commission, under which the Company was required to divest 145 stores, to enable the Merger to proceed under applicable antitrust, competition and trade regulation law. The divested stores had sales of $2.3 billion in fiscal 1998. Subsequent growth comparisons were affected by these divestitures. 3  The Company is one of the largest retail food and drug chains in the United States. As of February 1, 2001, the Company operated 2,512 stores in 36 Northeastern, Western, Midwestern and Southern states. These stores consist of 1,362 combination food-drug stores, 807 stand-alone drugstores, 315 conventional supermarkets and 28 warehouse stores. Retail operations are supported by 19 major Company distribution centers. The Company's distribution centers provide product exclusively to the Company's retail stores. The Company is organized, based on geographic boundaries, into 19 divisions. The division staff is responsible for day-to-day operations and for executing marketing and merchandising programs. This structure allows the division level employees, who are closest to the customer, to implement strategies tailored to each of the Company's unique neighborhoods. The Company's combination food-drug stores are super grocery/drugstores under one roof and range in size from 35,000 to 107,000 square feet. Most of these stores offer prescription drugs and an expanded section of cosmetics and general merchandise in addition to specialty departments such as service seafood and meat, bakery, lobby/video, service delicatessen, liquor and floral. Many also offer meal centers, party supply centers, coffee bars, in- store banks, dry cleaning, photo processing and destination categories for beverages, snacks, pet care products, paper products and baby care merchandise. All shopping areas are served by a common set of checkstands. The Company's stand-alone drugstores average 18,400 square feet. These stores offer convenient shopping and prescription pickup as well as a wide assortment of general merchandise, health and beauty care products, over-the-counter medication, greeting cards and photo processing. The Company's new drugstores are typically located on corners and many offer a drive-thru pharmacy. The Company's conventional supermarkets range in size from 8,000 to 35,000 square feet. These stores offer a full selection in the basic departments of grocery, meat, produce, dairy and limited general merchandise. Many locations have a pharmacy, in-store bakery and service delicatessen. The Company's warehouse stores are operated primarily under the names "Max Foods" and "Super Saver" and offer shoppers the opportunity to save by purchasing in quantity. These no-frills stores range in size from 17,000 to 70,000 square feet and offer significant savings with special emphasis on discounted meat and produce. Albertsons.com began serving online customers in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas market in 1998. In November 1999 the Company began testing an original concept in the Seattle/Bellevue, Washington area by combining a gourmet store with a fulfillment center, offering over 16,000 items. This new concept led to the launch, in June 2000, of a convenient pick-up service at 36 Albertson's stores in the Puget Sound area. The Company is continuing to refine this program and will use stores throughout the greater Seattle area to fill orders. The Company has found that by using technology, a limited number of orders per store can be selected and serve both the Company's traditional and cyber customers without the need for a separate fulfillment area. Savon.com, our online drugstore, serves the Company's customers nationwide. On December 7, 2000, Savon.com opened the "doors" to a nationwide online pharmacy service. The site offers a full range of sundry items, new and refill prescriptions and consumer health information. The Web site allows customers across the country the freedom to have new or refilled prescriptions ready for pickup at any local Albertson's food or drug store, or have their prescriptions mailed to their doorsteps. 4  All of the Company's stores carry a broad range of national brands and offer private label brand products in many merchandise categories. The Company's stores provide consumer information such as: nutritional signing in the meat and produce departments, freshness code dating, unit pricing, meal ideas and food information pamphlets. The Company also offers a choice of recyclable paper or plastic bags and collection bins for plastic bag recycling. As of February 1, 2001, the Company operated 150 fuel centers, in 21 states, which are generally located in the parking lot of stores. These centers feature three to six fuel pumps and a small building, ranging in size from a pay-only kiosk to a convenience store, featuring such items as candy, soft drinks and snack foods. The Company's operations are within a single operating segment, the retail sale of food and drug merchandise. The Company's stores operate under the names of Albertson's, Acme Markets, Jewel Food Stores, Seessel's, Super Saver, Max Foods, Osco Drug and Sav-On Drugs. The Company's business is highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on price, product quality and variety, service and location. There is direct competition from many local, regional and national supermarket chains, supercenters, club stores, specialty retailers such as pet centers and toy stores and large-scale drug and pharmaceutical retailers. Increasing competition also exists from convenience stores, prepared food retailers, liquor and video stores, film developing outlets and Internet and mail-order retailers. The Company is subject to effects of seasonality. Sales are higher in the Company's fourth quarter than other quarters due to the holiday season and the increase in cold and flu occurrences. The Company has been able to efficiently supply its stores with merchandise through its distribution centers, outside suppliers or directly from manufacturers in an effort to obtain merchandise at the lowest possible cost. The Company believes that it is not dependent on any one supplier, and considers its relations with its suppliers to be satisfactory. The Company services all of its retail stores from Company distribution centers. As of February 1, 2001, the Company employed approximately 235,000 people, many of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company considers its present relations with employees to be good. Item 2. Properties The Company has actively pursued an expansion program of adding new retail stores, enlarging and remodeling existing stores and replacing smaller stores. During the past ten years, the Company has built or acquired 1,248 stores and approximately 87% of the Company's current retail square footage has been opened or remodeled during this period. The Company continues to follow the policy of closing stores that are obsolete or lack satisfactory profit potential. Albertson's stores are located in 36 Northeastern, Western, Midwestern and Southern areas of the United States. The table on the following page is a summary of the stores by state and classification as of February 1, 2001: 5  The Company has expanded and improved its distribution facilities when opportunities exist to improve service to the retail stores and generate an adequate return on investment. During 2000 approximately 79% of the merchandise purchased for resale in Company retail stores was received from Company distribution centers. Albertson's distribution system consists of 19 major Company centers located strategically throughout the Company's operating markets. The table on the following page is a summary of the Company's distribution facilities as of February 1, 2001: 6  7  The Company currently finances most retail store and distribution facilities internally, thus retaining ownership of its land and buildings. The Company's future expansion plans are expected to be financed primarily from cash provided by operating activities. The Company has and will continue to finance a portion of its new stores through lease transactions when it does not have the opportunity to own the property. As of February 1, 2001, the Company held title to the land and buildings of 40% of the Company's stores and held title to the buildings on leased land of an additional 7% of the Company's stores. The Company also holds title to the land and buildings of most of its administrative offices and distribution facilities. Item 3.

If the chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, such chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting, and such business shall not be transacted.

Section 2.12 Record Date in General. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to 4  exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action (other than an action to be taken by written consent without a meeting), the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (a) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; and (b) in the case of any other action (other than an action to be taken by written consent without a meeting), shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action.

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. Section 2.13 Record Date for Stockholder Action by Written Consent. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the secretary of the Corporation, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of stockholders meetings are recorded, to the attention of the secretary of the Corporation. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. No consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be effective unless delivered to the Corporation within sixty days following the record date relating thereto fixed pursuant to this Section 2.13.

Unless otherwise required by law, inspectors may be officers, employees or agents of the Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector shall have the duties prescribed by law, shall take charge of the polls and, when the vote is completed, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken and of such other facts as may be required by law. ARTICLE III DIRECTORS Section 3.1 Number and Election of Directors. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be not less than three nor more than twenty- one. Within the limits above specified, the number of directors shall be determined by resolution of the Board or by the vote at the annual meeting of the holders of at least three-fourths of the outstanding shares of stock then entitled to vote in elections of directors. The Board shall be divided into three classes. Any increase or decrease in the number of directors shall be apportioned among the classes so as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible. No decrease in the authorized number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. At each annual meeting the successors to the class of directors whose term is then expiring shall be elected to hold office for a term of three years and until their respective successors are elected. Directors need not be stockholders. The chairman of the Board of Directors shall be an officer of the Corporation, and the vice chairman of the Board of Directors need not be an officer of the Corporation. The vice chairman of the Board of Directors shall be chosen by the Board of Directors and shall, in the absence of the chairman of the Board of Directors, preside at meetings of the Board of Directors.

B. Notice Requirement. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination of a director to be made by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof to the secretary of the Corporation in accordance with subsection C of this Section 3.2 in proper written form in accordance with subsection D of this Section 3.2. 6  C. Timeliness of Notice. To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the secretary of the Corporation of a nomination of a director must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (a) in the case of an annual meeting not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty days before or after such anniversary, in order to be timely, notice by the stockholder must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever occurs first; and (b) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever occurs first. D. Form of Notice. To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary of the Corporation of a nomination of a director must set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of stock of the Corporation that are owned beneficially or of record by the person and (iv) any other information relating to the person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and record address of such stockholder, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of stock of the Corporation that are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder, (iii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made by such stockholder, (iv) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice and (v) any other information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. E. Defective Nomination. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.2. If the chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective, and such defective nomination shall be disregarded. Section 3.3 Vacancies. Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director so chosen shall hold office until the 7 next election of the class for which such director has been chosen, and until his or her successor has been elected, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. If at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the entire Board of Directors (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent of the total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office. Section 3.4 Resignations and Removals of Directors. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time, by giving written notice to the chairman of the Board of Directors, or to the vice chairman, president or secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time therein specified or, if no time is specified, immediately; and, unless otherwise specified in such notice, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of preferred stock then outstanding, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors. As used in this Section 3.4, the term "cause" shall mean (a) conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, (b) administrative agency determination of conduct involving moral turpitude or (c) a determination in good faith, by a majority in voting power of the issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors after a hearing before at minimum such a majority in voting power, of conduct involving moral turpitude materially adverse to the interests of the Corporation. Section 3.5 Duties and Powers. The business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these by-laws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. Section 3.6 Indemnification. A. Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings Other than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation. Subject to subsection C of this Section 3.6, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such person had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not 8  act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. B. Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation. Subject to subsection C of this Section 3.6, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. C. Authorization of Indemnification. Any indemnification under this Section 3.6 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsection A or subsection B of this Section 3.6, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (a) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (b) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (c) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case. D. Good Faith Defined. For purposes of any determination under subsection C of this Section 3.6, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, if such person's action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this subsection D shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, 9  employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this subsection D shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsection A or subsection B of this Section 3.6, as the case may be. E. Indemnification by a Court. Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under subsection C of this Section 3.6, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under subsection A and subsection B of this Section 3.6. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in subsection A or subsection B of this Section 3.6, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under subsection C of this Section 3.6 nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this subsection E shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application. F. Expenses Payable in Advance. Expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section 3.6. G. Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation or any by-law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in subsection A and subsection B of this Section 3.6 shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Section 3.6 shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in subsection A or subsection B of this Section 3.6 but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "GCL"), or otherwise. H. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or 10  is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Section 3.6. I. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Section 3.6, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger that, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, o  fficer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 3.6 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have stood with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Section 3.6, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Section 3.6. J. Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 3.6 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. K. Limitation on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 3.6 to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by subsection E hereof), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) or advance expenses in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. L. Indemnification of Employees and Agents.

Notice thereof stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each director either by mail not less than forty-eight hours before the date of the meeting, by telephone, facsimile, telegram or other electronic means on twenty-four hours' notice, or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.

Section 3.10 Actions of Board. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these by- laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.

Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 3.11 shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. Section 3.12 Committees. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of such committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in one or more resolutions adopted by of the 12  Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the following matters: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the GCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (ii) adopting, amending or repealing any by-law of the Corporation.

No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because such person's or their votes are counted for such purpose if (a) the material facts as to such person's or their relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or (b) the material facts as to such person's or their relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (c) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders.

Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice except to the extent required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws.

In consideration of the grant of this award of Deferred Stock Units, the Participant agrees during the term of this agreement and for a period of one year from the Vesting Date not to become employed by another company in the food and/or drug business that competes against the Company. 6. The terms of the Plan with regard to change of control (Section 13 of the Plan) will apply to this award. 7. The Participant will not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Stock issueable pursuant to the Deferred Stock Units until the date on which a stock certificate (or certificates) representing such Stock is issued. 8. The number of shares of Stock issueable pursuant to the Deferred Stock Units are subject to equitable adjustment as provided in Section 14 of the Plan. 9. Notices hereunder will be mailed or delivered to the Company at the Corporate Secretary's Department, Albertson's, Inc., P.O. Box 20, Boise, Idaho 83726 and will be mailed or delivered to the Participant at the Participant's address set forth in the payroll records of the Company, or in either case at such other address as one party may subsequently furnish to the other party in writing. 10. This award will not confer upon the Participant any right with respect to continuance of employment by the Company, nor will it interfere in any way with any right of the Company to terminate the Participant's employment at any time. 11. The laws of the State of Delaware will govern this award and all matters related hereto. 12. This award is subject to the terms of the Plan, and the Participant is being delivered a copy of the Plan with this award agreement. 13. The Participant will pay to the Company, on demand, any taxes the Company reasonably determines it is required to withhold under applicable tax laws with respect to the Deferred Stock Units or the issuance of Stock pursuant to this award. The tax withholding obligation may be satisfied by the Participant instructing the Company to withhold shares of stock otherwise issueable pursuant to this award in order to satisfy the minimum tax withholding amount permissible under the method that results in the least amount withheld. 14. This agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will be an original but all of which together will represent one and the same agreement. 15. This agreement cannot be changed or terminated orally. The agreement and the Plan contain the entire  agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. ALBERTSON'S, INC.

Advisor has determined to tender his resignation to the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") effective upon the adjournment of the Company's 2001 Annual Meeting (the "Resignation Date"). Notwithstanding such resignation, the Board desires that the Company and its stockholders shall continue to benefit from the experience and ability of the Advisor as a consultant to the Company, and the Advisor is willing to commit himself to serve as a Special Advisor to the Board, on the terms and conditions herein provided. Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the respective covenants and agreements of the parties herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 1. RETAINER. The Company hereby retains the Advisor, effective as of the Resignation Date, and the Advisor hereby agrees to become a Special Advisor to the Board for the Term provided in Section 3 to render the consulting services described in Section 2. 2. DUTIES. 2.1 Assignment of Duties. During the Term, as defined in Section 3 of this Agreement, the Advisor shall be available to the Company to provide such consulting and other services as may reasonably be required of him by the Board. 2.2 Availability. The Advisor agrees to devote to the Company such time as shall be necessary for the effective conduct of his duties hereunder. Advisor shall be permitted to engage in outside business and other interests that do not conflict with such duties. Advisor shall not be required to provide services to the Company in excess of ten hours per month. 3. TERM. The term of the Advisor's retainer under this Agreement (the "Term") shall commence on the Resignation Date (also called the "Effective Date") and shall expire on the second anniversary of the Effective Date unless sooner terminated pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement. 1  4. COMPENSATION. 4.1 Cash Portion of Consulting Fee. The Company shall pay the Advisor a cash fee at the rate of $40,000 per annum during the Term (the "Consulting Fee"). The Consulting Fee shall be payable at the same time, in the same manner, and following the same procedures as apply to directors' fees paid to non-employee directors of the Company. All such payments shall be subject to deduction and withholding (if any) authorized or required by applicable law. 4.2 Equity Portion of Consulting Fee. Advisor shall be awarded $60,000 of Company common stock annually during the Term pursuant to the Company's 1995 Stock-Based Incentive Plan. Advisor may choose to receive such awards in the form of Company common stock, deferred Company stock equivalents or options to purchase Company common stock. Awards in the form of stock options shall be at a ratio of four (4) stock option shares to one (1) share of Company common stock that may otherwise be awarded pursuant to this Section 4.2. Equity compensation awarded pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be made at the same time, in the same manner, and following the same procedures as apply to equity awards made to non-employee directors of the Company. The compensation provided for in Section 4.1 and 4.2 hereof is referred to herein as the "Consulting Fee." 4.3 No Offset Effect. Any other compensation received by the Advisor for services performed for the Company or its affiliates shall not operate as an offset to the compensation due pursuant to Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 of this Agreement. 4.4 Expense Reimbursement. The Company shall reimburse the Advisor for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to travel, entertainment and miscellaneous expense incurred in carrying out his duties under this Agreement. Reimbursement shall only be made against an itemized list of such expenditures signed by the Advisor in such form as required by the Company and consistent with the Company's policy. 5. TERMINATION. 5.1 Termination Upon Death or Disability. In the event of the Advisor's death or total disability (defined as the Advisor's inability to perform his duties under this Agreement for three (3) consecutive fiscal quarters) during the Term, this Agreement shall terminate on the date of such death or disability; provided that, such termination shall not relieve the Company of its 2  obligations to make the payments as described in Section 4 hereof accrued through the date of such termination. 5.2 Termination for Cause; Voluntary Termination Prior to Term-End. The Company may terminate this Agreement for "Cause" at any time and without notice. The Company shall have "Cause" to terminate this Agreement if (a) Advisor breaches any provision of this Agreement or (b) Advisor engages in conduct which is injurious to the Company as determined by the Board. If the Advisor is terminated by the Company for Cause or if the Advisor voluntarily terminates his services prior to the end of the Term (other than due to the Advisor's death or disability) then the Advisor shall be paid only the Consulting Fee accrued through the date of such termination and the Advisor will forfeit all right to receive any other payments from the Company unless previously earned but unpaid and any other compensation to which he would otherwise be entitled. 5.3 Termination by the Company other than for Cause. If the Advisor is terminated by the Company other than for Cause prior to the end of the Term, then the Advisor shall be entitled to payment of the total amount of the Consulting Fee which would have been paid hereunder if his services were not so terminated by the Company (less any amount of the Consulting Fee already paid). 6. CONFIDENTIALITY. 6.1 Confidentiality of Trade Secrets or Proprietary Information. Advisor acknowledges that, during Advisor's service with the Company, Advisor has had access to proprietary information, trade secrets, and confidential material of the Company and its affiliates, successors and assigns, including, without limitation, information concerning the Company's operations, policies and procedures, present and future business plans, financial information, budgets and projections, methods of doing business, and marketing, research and development activities and strategies ("Confidential Information"). Advisor agrees, without limitation in time or until the Confidential Information shall become public other than by Advisor's unauthorized disclosure, to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and refrain from divulging, disclosing, or otherwise using the Confidential Information to the detriment of the Company or its affiliates, successors or assigns, or for any other purpose or no purpose. 6.2 Enforceability of Provisions/Remedies. Advisor agrees that any breach of the covenants contained in this Section 6 would irreparably injure the Company. Accordingly, the Company may, in addition to pursuing any other remedies they may have in law or in equity, obtain an injunction against Advisor 3  from any court having jurisdiction over the matter, restraining any further violation of this Section 6 by Advisor. 7. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company agrees to indemnify, protect, defend and hold the Advisor and his estate, heirs, and personal representatives, harmless from and against any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), and all losses, liabilities, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees incurred by counsel reasonably designated or approved by him, in connection with this Agreement or his services hereunder, provided that any consulting services giving rise to such indemnification shall have been performed by the Advisor in good faith and, to the best of his or her knowledge, in a lawful manner. 8. OTHER PROVISIONS. 8.1 Independent Contractor Status. Advisor hereby acknowledges that Advisor's services to the Company during the Term of this Agreement will be as an independent contractor and not as an employee and even if Advisor is subsequently determined to have been an employee during such Term, he waives any rights he might have to benefits of any type whatsoever, from and after the Effective Date, except as specifically provided for herein. 8.2 Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be effective three (3) business days after it is properly sent by registered or certified mail to the following addresses or twenty-four (24) hours if sent via facsimile: If to the Company: Albertson's, Inc. 250 Parkcenter Blvd. Boise, ID 83706 Attn: Corporate Secretary If to Advisor, the address set forth on the signature page to this Agreement.

This Agreement may be amended, superseded, cancelled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument signed by the parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance. No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. Each of the sections contained in this Agreement shall be enforceable, independently of every other section in this Agreement, and the invalidity or enforceability of any section shall not invalidate or render nonenforceable any other section contained herein. If any section or provision in a section is found invalid or unenforceable, it is the intent of the parties that a court of competent jurisdiction shall reform the section or provisions to produce its nearest enforceable economic equivalent. 8.5 Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this agreement shall in all respects be governed by the laws of Delaware, without reference to principles of conflict of law. 8.6 Assignment. The services to be rendered by the Advisor hereunder are personal in nature and, thus, the obligations of the Advisor under this Agreement may not be assigned to any other party. 8.7 Counterparts.

EX-10 16 abs10k2000exhibit10-312.txt AMENDMENT TO STOCK PLAN FOR NON EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS  Exhibit 10.31.2 AMENDMENT TO THE AMERICAN STORES COMPANY 1997 STOCK PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS This Amendment is made by Albertson's, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"). RECITALS: A. The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board"), pursuant to Section 13 of the Plan, may amend the Plan as it may deem proper and in the best interests of the Corporation; and B. The Board has determined that it is advisable to amend the Plan and the options heretofore granted in the manner hereinafter set forth and that such amendments do not impair the rights of a participant under any award theretofore granted. AMENDMENT The Plan is amended, as of March 15, 2001, in the following respects: 1. Section 2 of the Plan is amended and restated to read, in its entirety, as follows: "PURPOSE OF PLAN. The purpose of the Plan is to enable American Stores Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and special advisors to the Board ("Special Advisors"), to enhance the equity interest of directors and Special Advisors in the Corporation, and to solidify the common interests of its directors, Special Advisors and stockholders in enhancing the value of the Corporation's common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common Stock"). The Plan seeks to encourage the highest level of director and Special Advisor performance by providing such directors and Special Advisors with a proprietary interest in the Corporation's performance and progress by crediting them with Common Stock annually as part of their annual retainer." 2. Section 4 of the Plan is amended and restated to read, in its entirety, as follows: "ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS. Each member of the Board on the date of the 1997 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and each member of the Board and each Special Advisor from time to time thereafter who is not a full-time employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be a participant ("Participant") in the Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, service as a Special Advisor shall be treated as service as a director for all purposes and no termination of service shall be deemed to occur in the event a director is designated as a Special Advisor in connection with such director's termination of directorship. Each credit of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan shall be evidenced by a written agreement duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Corporation and a Participant, if such an agreement is required by the Corporation to assure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations." IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amendment to the Plan has been duly executed by the undersigned as of March 15, 2001. ALBERTSON'S, INC. By: /s/ Thomas R. Saldin --------------------- Name: Thomas R. Saldin Title: Executive Vice President and General Counsel 2  EX-13 17 abs10k2000exhibit13.txt 2000 ANNUAL REPORT  Exhibit 13 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share data) Business Combinations On June 23, 1999, Albertson's, Inc. ("Albertson's" or the "Company") and American Stores Company ("ASC") consummated a merger with the issuance of 177 million shares of Albertson's common stock (the "Merger"). The Merger constituted a tax-free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The pooling of interests method of accounting is intended to present, as a single interest, two or more common stockholders' interests that were previously independent; accordingly, these consolidated financial statements restate the historical financial statements as though the companies had always been combined. The restated consolidated financial statements are adjusted to conform accounting policies and financial statement presentations. The following table compares amounts previously reported by Albertson's and ASC prior to the Merger transaction and the combined amounts for fiscal 1998: In connection with the Merger, the Company entered into agreements with the Attorneys General of California, Nevada and New Mexico and the Federal Trade Commission, under which the Company was required to divest 145 stores to enable the Merger to proceed under applicable antitrust, competition and trade regulation law. The divested stores had sales of $2,300 in fiscal 1998. Subsequent growth comparisons were affected by these divestitures. During 1998 the Company acquired the stock of three separate operating companies representing 64 retail food and drug stores in transactions accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. In accordance with an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, nine acquired stores and six previously owned stores were divested. Reported results include these operations from the date of consummation of the acquisition. 1 Albertson's, Inc.  Results of Operations Sales for 2000 were $36,762 compared to $37,478 in 1999 (a 53-week year) and $35,872 in 1998. The following table sets forth certain income statement components expressed as a percent to sales, and the year-to-year percentage changes in the amounts of such components: Sales for 2000 increased 3.8% when compared on a 52-week basis to the prior year and excluding sales from divested stores from both years. Increases in sales are primarily attributable to the continued development of new stores and identical and comparable store sales increases. During 2000 the Company opened or acquired 91 stores, remodeled 114 stores and closed or sold 71 stores. Net retail square footage increased by 2.5% during 2000. During 1999, net retail square footage decreased by 1.7%. The 1999 decrease includes the effect of required divestitures, which reduced square footage by 6.1 million square feet or 6.2% from 1998. Identical store sales, stores that have been in operation for two full fiscal years, increased 0.3% in 2000 and 1.7% in 1999. Comparable store sales, which include replacement stores, increased 0.6% in 2000 and 2.1% in 1999. Identical and comparable store sales continued to increase through higher average ticket sales per customer. Management estimates that there was overall deflation in products the Company sells of approximately 0.4% in 2000, overall inflation of 0.2% in 1999 and overall deflation of 0.1% in 1998. In addition to store development, the Company has increased sales through its continued implementation of best practices across the Company and its investment in programs designed to provide solutions to customer needs. These programs include the Front End Manager program; the "Quick Fixin' Ideas" home meal solutions process; special destination categories; and increased emphasis on training programs utilizing Computer Guided Training. To provide additional solutions to customer needs, in 1999 the Company added new gourmet-quality bakery products and organic grocery and produce items. Other solutions include neighborhood marketing, targeted advertising and exciting new and remodeled stores. Gross profit, as a percent to sales, increased primarily as a result of improved sales mix of partially prepared, value-added products. Gross profit improvements were also realized through the continued utilization of Company distribution facilities and increased buying efficiencies. The merger has created buying synergies and margin improvements from the implementation of best practices across the Company. The pre-tax LIFO adjustment, as a percent to sales, increased gross margin by $23 (0.06%) in 2000 and reduced gross margin by $30 (0.08%) in 1999 and $16 (0.04%) in 1998. The increase in 2000 is due to deflation and lower inventory levels. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent to sales increased in 2000, primarily due to increased salary and related benefit costs resulting from the Company's initiatives to increase sales, increased depreciation expense associated with the Company's expansion program and larger losses from asset impairment and disposition. The increase in 1999 over 1998 was primarily due to integration costs associated with the Merger, including activities associated with the banner change in California, Nevada and New Mexico. 2 Albertson's, Inc. Results of operations for year ended February 1, 2001, include $151 of merger- related costs ($93 after tax) and the results of operations for year ended February 3, 2000, included $683 of merger-related costs ($529 after tax). The following table presents the pre-tax costs incurred by category of expenditure and merger-related accruals included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: Severance costs consist of obligations to employees who were terminated or were notified of termination under a plan authorized by senior management. Total merger-related terminations were 663 employees as of February 1, 2001, and no further terminations are expected under this plan. The write-down of assets to net realizable value includes the expected loss on disposal of stores required to be divested and duplicate and abandoned facilities, including administrative offices, intangibles and information technology equipment which were abandoned by the Company or are being held for sale. The estimated fair value of assets held for sale has been determined using negotiated sales prices or independent appraisals. Transaction and financing costs consist primarily of professional fees paid for investment banking, legal, accounting, printing and regulatory filing fees. Financing costs also include the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt. Integration costs consist primarily of incremental transition and integration costs associated with integrating the operations of Albertson's and ASC and are being expensed as incurred. These include such costs as advertising, labor associated with systems conversions and training and relocation costs. The Company's stock option award plans contain provisions for automatic vesting upon a change of control. Under ASC plans, option holders had the right (limited stock appreciation right or LSAR), during an exercise period of up to 60 days after the occurrence of a change of control (but prior to consummation of the Merger), to elect to surrender all or part of their options in exchange for shares of Albertson's common stock having a value equal to the excess of the change of control price over the exercise price. Certain stock option plans of ASC defined change of control as the date of stockholder approval of the Merger. Approval of the Merger Agreement on November 12, 1998, by ASC's stockholders accelerated the vesting of 6.4 million equivalent stock options granted under pre-1997 ASC plans and permitted the holders of these options to exercise LSARs. The exercisability of the 6.4 million LSARs resulted in the Company recognizing a pre-tax $195 merger-related stock option charge during 1998. 3 Albertson's, Inc.  In the first quarter of 1999, a market price adjustment of $29 was recorded as a reduction of pre-tax merger-related costs to reflect a decline in the relevant stock price at the end of the first fiscal quarter relative to LSARs. The actual change of control price used to measure the value of these exercised LSARs became determinable at the date the Merger was consummated and resulted in no further adjustments. Upon Merger consummation, the change of control price was $53.77 per share, resulting in the issuance of approximately 1.7 million Albertson's shares. LSARs relating to approximately 4.0 million equivalent stock options became exercisable upon regulatory approval of the Merger, which resulted in recognition of an additional pre-tax charge of $76 in the second quarter of fiscal 1999. This charge was based upon a change of control price of $56.96 per share, which included an adjustment factor for the early termination of the LSAR feature. A total of 0.8 million Albertson's shares were issued in satisfaction of those options for which the LSAR feature was elected and the remaining options were converted into options to acquire approximately 1.2 million Albertson's shares. The Company recorded a $20 pre-tax one-time charge to earnings during first quarter of 2000 and included it in selling, general and administrative expenses to reflect liabilities related to certain previously assigned leases and subleases to tenants who are in bankruptcy. The Company recorded a $37 pre-tax one-time charge to earnings during the third quarter of 1999 resulting from an agreement reached to settle eight multi-state cases combined in the United States District Court in Boise, Idaho, which raised various issues including "off-the-clock" work allegations. Under the agreement, current and former employees who meet eligibility criteria may present their claims to a settlement administrator. While the Company cannot specify the exact number of individuals who are likely to submit claims and the exact amount of their claims, the one-time charge is the Company's current estimate of the total monetary liability, including attorney fees, for all eight cases. The Company recorded an impairment charge to earnings during 1998 related to management's decision to close 16 underperforming stores in eight states. The $24 pre-tax charge included impaired real estate and equipment, as well as the present value of remaining liabilities under leases, net of expected sublease recoveries. The Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations for 2000 was 40.0%, as compared to 52.5% for 1999 and 40.2% for 1998. The increase for 1999 is primarily due to the non-deductible portion of merger- related costs. Due to the significance of the merger-related costs and other one-time expenses and their effect on operating results, the following table is presented to assist in the comparison of income statement components without these costs and expenses: 4 Albertson's, Inc.  The costs of integrating the two companies have resulted in significant non-recurring charges and incremental expenses. These costs had a significant effect on both 2000 and 1999 results of operations of the Company. Non-recurring charges and expenses of implementing integration actions were originally estimated to total $700 after income tax benefits. On an after-tax basis, and subsequent to the first quarter 1999, the Company has incurred $638 of merger-related costs and does not expect to exceed its original estimate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities during 2000 was $1,780, compared to $1,418 in 1999 and $1,441 in 1998. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2000 was primarily impacted by higher earnings when compared to fiscal 1999. Also, driving the change is the decrease in inventories offset by the decrease in other current liabilities, mostly tax related. Cash provided by operating activities during 1999 was negatively impacted by $230 for merger-related after-tax expenditures (the offsetting proceeds from divestitures is included with cash flow from investing activities). These expenditures include severance, transaction, financing and integration costs. In addition, for fiscal 1999 a combination of increased inventories and the reduction of accounts payable leverage negatively impacted cash provided from operating activities. During 2000 the Company implemented several initiatives designed to enhance working capital, which include reducing inventory levels and increasing accounts payable leverage. The Company intends to continue these initiatives, which are expected to reduce the cash requirements of the business. The Company's financing activities for 2000 included net new borrowings of $340 and dividend payments of $315 (which represents 36.3% of 2000 net earnings without merger-related costs and one- time expenses). The Company also purchased and retired 18.7 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $451. The Board of Directors at its March 2001 meeting maintained the regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share, for an annual rate of $0.76 per share. The Company utilizes its commercial paper and bank line programs primarily to supplement cash requirements for seasonal fluctuations in working capital and to fund its capital expenditure program. Accordingly, commercial paper and bank line borrowings will fluctuate between reporting periods. The Company had $1,128 of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at February 1, 2001, as compared to $1,628 outstanding as of February 3, 2000. In support of the Company's commercial paper program, the Company had two credit facilities totaling $1,900 during fiscal 2000. One agreement for $950 expired in March 2001 and was replaced by a $700 364-day credit agreement. A second agreement for $950 expires in March 2005. At the expiration of the 364-day credit agreement and upon due notice, the Company may extend the term for an additional 364-day period if the lenders holding at least 75% of the commitments agree. The 364-day agreement also contains an option which would allow the Company, upon due notice, to convert any outstanding amounts at the expiration date to term loans. The agreements contain certain covenants, the most restrictive of which requires the Company to maintain consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, of at least $2,100. In addition the Company executed a $200 forward underwriting agreement in December 2000 to support the commercial paper program. This agreement expired in March 2001. The Company also has an uncommitted bank line of credit totaling $25. The entire amount under the bank line was outstanding as of February 1, 2001. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities (including the forward underwriting agreement) as of February 1, 2001, and February 3, 2000. Following the Merger, the Company consolidated several of the commercial paper, bank lines and other financing arrangements. The consolidation of debt included the repayment of ASC debt containing change of control provisions and the tender for, or open market purchases of, certain higher coupon debt. At the effective date of the Merger, approximately $900 of ASC's debt became due or callable by the creditors due to change of control provisions, of which approximately $700 was repaid, and a $200 term loan was amended to waive the change of control provision. Albertson's filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which became effective in February 2001 (the "2001 Registration Statement"), to authorize the issuance of up to $3,000 in debt securities. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of any securities sold pursuant to the 2001 Registration Statement for retirement of debt and general corporate purposes, including the potential purchase of outstanding shares of Albertson's common stock. 5 Albertson's, Inc.  Albertson's filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which became effective in February 1999 (the "1999 Registration Statement"), to authorize issuance of up to $2,500 in debt securities. In January 2001 the Company issued $700 of term notes under the 1999 Registration Statement. The notes consist of $700 of principal bearing interest at 7.5% due February 15, 2011. Proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program. In May 2000 the Company issued $500 of term notes under the 1999 Registration Statement. The notes are composed of $275 of principal bearing interest at 8.35% due May 1, 2010, and $225 of principal bearing interest at 8.7% due May 1, 2030. Proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program. In July 1999 the Company issued $1,300 of term notes under the 1999 Registration Statement. The notes are composed of $300 of principal bearing interest at 6.55% due August 1, 2004; $350 of principal bearing interest at 6.95% due August 1, 2009; and $650 of principal bearing interest at 7.45% due August 1, 2029. Proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program. During 1998 Albertson's issued a total of $317 in medium-term notes under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in December 1997. Proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce borrowings under Albertson's commercial paper program. On March 19, 1998, ASC issued $45 of 6.5% notes due March 20, 2008, under an outstanding Series B Medium-Term Note Program. On March 30, 1998, ASC issued an additional $100 of 7.1% notes due March 20, 2028, under the same program. Proceeds were used to refinance short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. The Board of Directors adopted a program on April 25, 2000, authorizing, but not requiring, the Company to purchase and retire up to $500 of the Company's common stock. This program was increased by an additional $1,000 by the Board of Directors on December 6, 2000, for a total of $1,500. The revised program enables the Company to purchase stock from April 25, 2000, through December 6, 2001. During fiscal 2000 the Company purchased and retired 18.7 million shares at a total cost of $451 or an average price of $24.15 per share. The Company's operating results continue to enhance its financial position and ability to continue its planned expansion program. Cash flows from operations and available borrowings are sufficient for the future operating and capital needs of the Company. The following leverage ratios demonstrate the Company's levels of long-term financing as of the indicated year end: The Company continues to retain ownership of real estate when possible. As of February 1, 2001, the Company held title to the land and buildings of 40% of the Company's stores and held title to the buildings on leased land of an additional 7% of the Company's stores. The Company also holds title to the land and buildings of most of its administrative offices and distribution facilities. 6 Albertson's, Inc.  The Company is committed to keeping its stores up to date. In the last three years, the Company has opened or remodeled 727 stores representing 32% of the Company's retail square footage as of February 1, 2001. The following summary of historical capital expenditures includes capital leases, stores acquired in business and asset acquisitions, assets acquired with related debt and the estimated fair value of property financed by operating leases: The Company's strong financial position provides the flexibility for the Company to grow through its store development program and future acquisitions. Recent Accounting Standard In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. This new standard as amended establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 effective February 2, 2001. The Company has completed its evaluation of this standard and its impact on the Company's accounting and reporting requirements and management does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in the Company's financial instruments, which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company enters into derivative transactions. The objective of these derivative transactions is to reduce the Company's exposure to changes in interest rates, and each transaction is evaluated periodically by the Company for changes in market value and counterparty credit exposure. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its fixed interest rate debt obligations. Commercial paper borrowings do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings have maturities of less than three months. Generally, the fair value of debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and the fair value will decrease as interest rates rise. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing a combination of fixed rate borrowings and commercial paper borrowings. During 1997 ASC entered into a $300 five-year LIBOR basket swap. The LIBOR basket swap agreement diversified the indices used to determine the interest rate on a portion of ASC's variable rate debt by providing for payments based on an average of foreign LIBOR indices which reset every three months, and also provided for a maximum interest rate of 8.0%. The Company recognized no income or expense in 1998 or 1997 related to this swap. During 1999 ASC terminated the LIBOR basket swap and recognized a loss of $1. There have been no material changes in the primary risk exposures or management of the risks since the prior year. The Company expects to continue to manage risks in accordance with the current policy. 7 Albertson's, Inc.  The table below provides information about the Company's debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates: Environmental The Company has identified environmental contamination sites related primarily to underground petroleum storage tanks and groundwater contamination at various store, warehouse, office and manufacturing facilities (related to current operations as well as previously disposed of businesses). The Company conducts an ongoing program for the inspection and evaluation of new sites proposed to be acquired by the Company and the remediation/monitoring of contamination at existing and previously owned sites. Undiscounted reserves have been established for each environmental contamination site unless an unfavorable outcome is remote. Although the ultimate outcome and expense of environmental remediation is uncertain, the Company believes that required remediation and continuing compliance with environmental laws, in excess of current reserves, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company. Charges against earnings for environmental remediation were not material in 2000, 1999 or 1998.

The Company The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is the successor to a business founded by J.A. Albertson in 1939. Based on sales, the Company is one of the largest retail food and drug chains in the United States. As of February 1, 2001, the Company operated 2,512 stores in 36 Western, Midwestern, Eastern and Southern states. Retail operations are supported by 19 major Company distribution operations, strategically located in the Company's operating markets. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies FISCAL YEAR END The Company's fiscal year is generally 52 weeks and periodically consists of 53 weeks because the fiscal year ends on the Thursday nearest to January 31 (the Saturday nearest to January 31 for ASC during fiscal year 1998). During fiscal 1999, ASC's fiscal year was converted from a Saturday year end to a Thursday year end. Unless the context otherwise indicates, reference to a fiscal year of the Company refers to the calendar year in which such fiscal year commences. CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations, account balances and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances have been eliminated. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments, which consist of government-backed money market funds and repurchase agreements backed by government securities, are recorded at cost which approximates market value. INVENTORIES The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost of substantially all inventories is determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. CAPITALIZATION, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Land, buildings and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight- line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Estimated useful lives are generally as follows: buildings and improvements-10 to 35 years; fixtures and equipment-3 to 10 years; software-3 to 5 years; leasehold improvements-10 to 25 years; intangibles-3 to 10 years; and capitalized leases-20 to 30 years. The costs of major remodeling and improvements on leased stores are capitalized as leasehold improvements. Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease or the useful life of the asset. Assets under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the fair market value of the asset or the present value of future minimum lease payments. These leases are amortized on the straight-line method over their primary term. Beneficial lease rights and lease liabilities are recorded on purchased leases based on differences between contractual rents under the respective lease agreements and prevailing market rents at the date of the acquisition of the lease. Beneficial lease rights and lease liabilities are amortized over the lease term using the straight-line method. GOODWILL - Goodwill resulting from business acquisitions represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired and is being amortized over 40 years using the straight-line method. Goodwill is principally from the acquisition of Lucky Stores, Inc. in 1988. Accumulated amortization amounted to $660 and $603 in 2000 and 1999, respectively. 13 Albertson's, Inc.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS The Company reviews and evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate costs may not be recoverable. The net book value of long-lived assets is compared to expected undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment loss would be recorded for the excess of net book value over the fair value of the asset impaired. The fair value is estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows. SELF-INSURANCE The Company is partially self-insured for property loss, workers' compensation and general liability costs. For ASC, beginning in fiscal 1998 through first quarter 2000, insurance was purchased for workers' compensation, general liability and automotive liability coverage. Self-insurance liabilities are determined actuarially based on claims filed and estimates for claims incurred but not reported. The majority of these liabilities are not discounted. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail sales. Vendor allowances and credits that relate to the Company's buying and merchandising activity are recognized as earned. STORE OPENING AND CLOSING COSTS Noncapital expenditures incurred in opening new stores or remodeling existing stores are expensed in the year in which they are incurred. When a store is closed, the remaining investment in land, buildings and equipment, net of expected recovery value, is expensed. For properties under operating lease agreements, the present value of any remaining liability under the lease, net of expected sublease recovery, is also expensed. ADVERTISING Advertising costs incurred to produce media advertising for major new campaigns are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Other advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Cooperative advertising income from vendors is recorded in the period in which the related expense is incurred. Gross advertising expenses of $550, $654 and $631, excluding cooperative advertising income from vendors, were included with cost of sales in the Company's Consolidated Earnings for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. STOCK OPTIONS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," encourages, but does not require, companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value. The Company has chosen to continue to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost of stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's stock at the date of the grant over the option exercise price and is charged to operations over the vesting period. Income tax benefits attributable to stock options exercised are credited to capital in excess of par value. COMPANY-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE The Company has purchased life insurance policies to cover its obligations under certain deferred compensation plans for officers, key employees and directors. Cash surrender values of these policies are adjusted for fluctuations in the market value of underlying investments. The cash surrender value is adjusted each reporting period and any gain or loss is included with other income (expense) in the Company's Consolidated Earnings. INCOME TAXES The Company provides for deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences in reporting certain income and expense items for income tax and financial accounting purposes. The major temporary differences and their net effect are shown in the "Income Taxes" note. Amortization of goodwill is generally not deductible for purposes of calculating income tax provisions. EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) Basic EPS is computed by dividing consolidated net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing consolidated net earnings by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted average number of potential common shares outstanding. Potential common shares consist primarily of outstanding options under the Company's stock option plans. Outstanding options excluded in 2000 and 1999 (option price exceeded the average market price during the period) amounted to 16.6 million shares and 3.5 million shares, respectively. There were no outstanding options excluded from the computation of potential common shares in 1998. In connection with the Merger, certain options of ASC were exchanged for shares of Albertson's based on the fair value of the options, including contractual rights. For purposes of the EPS calculation, all shares and potential common shares of ASC were converted at the 0.63 to 1 exchange ratio. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME The Company has no items of other comprehensive income in any period presented. Therefore, net earnings as presented in the Company's Consolidated Earnings equals comprehensive income. 14 Albertson's, Inc.  USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years' financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year. Merger, Divestitures and Related Costs The following table compares amounts previously reported by Albertson's and ASC prior to the Merger transaction and the combined amounts for fiscal 1998: In connection with the Merger, the Company entered into agreements with the Attorneys General of California, Nevada and New Mexico and the Federal Trade Commission. Under these agreements, the Company was required to divest 145 stores to enable the Merger to proceed under applicable antitrust, competition and trade regulation law. The stores divested had sales of $2,300 in fiscal 1998. Results of operations for year ended February 1, 2001, included $151 of merger-related costs ($93 after tax) and the results of operations for year ended February 3, 2000, included $683 of merger-related costs ($529 after tax). The following table presents the pre-tax costs incurred by category of expenditure and merger-related accruals included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: 15 Albertson's, Inc.  Severance costs consist of obligations to employees who were terminated or were notified of termination under a plan authorized by senior management. Total merger- related terminations were 663 employees as of February 1, 2001, and no further terminations are expected under this plan. The write-down of assets to net realizable value includes the expected loss on disposal of stores required to be divested and duplicate and abandoned facilities, including administrative offices, intangibles and information technology equipment which were abandoned by the Company or are being held for sale. The estimated fair value of assets held for sale has been determined using negotiated sales prices or independent appraisals. Transaction and financing costs consist primarily of professional fees paid for investment banking, legal, accounting, printing and regulatory filing fees. Financing costs also include the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt. Integration costs consist primarily of incremental transition and integration costs associated with integrating the operations of Albertson's and ASC and are being expensed as incurred. These include such costs as advertising, labor associated with systems conversions and training and relocation costs. As discussed in the "Stock Options and Stock Awards" note, the Company recorded net pre-tax charges through the first two quarters of 1999 of $47 related to limited stock appreciation rights (LSARs). The actual change of control price used to measure the value of these exercised LSARs became determinable at the date the Merger was consummated. The costs of integrating the two companies have resulted in significant non-recurring charges and incremental expenses. These costs had a significant effect on both 2000 and 1999 results of operations of the Company. Non-recurring charges and expenses of implementing integration actions were originally estimated to total $700 after income tax benefits. On an after-tax basis, and subsequent to first quarter 1999, the Company has incurred $638 of merger-related costs and does not expect to exceed its original estimate. Supplemental Cash Flow Information Selected cash payments and noncash activities were as follows: Business Acquisitions During 1998 the Company acquired 64 stores in three separate stock purchase acquisitions and 15 stores in an asset acquisition transaction. In connection with one of the stock purchase acquisitions, the Company agreed with the Federal Trade Commission to divest nine of the acquired stores and six previously owned stores. These four acquisition transactions had a combined purchase price of $302. The above acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in the consolidated financial statements from their date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented due to the immaterial effects of these acquisitions on the Company's consolidated operations. For these acquisitions, the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired, of $151, was allocated to goodwill which is being amortized over 40 years. 16 Albertson's, Inc.  Accounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable consist of the following: Inventories Approximately 97% of the Company's inventories are valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. If the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method had been used, inventories would have been $591 and $614 higher at the end of 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net earnings (basic and diluted earnings per share) would have been lower by $14 ($0.03) in 2000, higher by $18 ($0.04) in 1999, and higher by $10 ($0.02) in 1998. The replacement cost of inventories valued at LIFO approximates FIFO cost. During 2000, inventory quantities were reduced. This reduction resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of 2000 purchases, the effect of which decreased cost of goods sold by approximately $26 and increased net income by approximately $15 or $0.04 per share. Land, Buildings and Equipment, net Land, buildings and equipment, net, consist of the following: 17 Albertson's, Inc.  Indebtedness Long-term debt consists of the following (borrowings are unsecured unless indicated): Interest rates on the outstanding commercial paper borrowings as of February 1, 2001, ranged from 6.2% to 8.0% with an effective weighted average rate of 7.3%. The Company has established the necessary credit facilities, through its revolving credit agreements, to refinance the commercial paper and bank line borrowings on a long-term basis. These borrowings have been classified as noncurrent because it is the Company's intent to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis. Following the Merger the Company consolidated several of the commercial paper, bank lines and other financing arrangements. The consolidation of debt included the repayment of outstanding amounts under ASC's revolving credit facilities and other debt containing change of control provisions and the tender for, or open market purchases of, certain higher coupon debt. As a result, the following debt was extinguished during 1999: 18 Albertson's, Inc. In July 1999 the Company issued $500 million of floating rate notes under the commercial paper program with interest based on LIBOR commercial paper rates that reset monthly. These notes were paid in full during July 2000. Effective March 2000 the Company entered into two new revolving credit agreements for $1,900. One agreement for $950 expired in March 2001 and was replaced by a $700 364-day credit agreement. A second agreement for $950 expires in March 2005. At the expiration of the 364-day credit agreement and upon due notice, the Company may extend the term for an additional 364-day period if lenders holding at least 75% of commitments agree. The 364-day agreement also contains an option which would allow the Company, upon due notice, to convert any outstanding amounts at the expiration date to term loans. The agreements contain certain covenants, the most restrictive of which requires the Company to maintain consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, of at least $2,100. In addition, the Company executed a $200 forward underwriting agreement in December 2000 to support the commercial paper program. This agreement expired in March 2001. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities (including the forward underwriting agreement) as of February 1, 2001. During fiscal 2000 the Company had an uncommitted bank line of credit totaling $25. The entire amount under the bank line was outstanding as of February 1, 2001. Albertson's filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which became effective in February 1999 (the "1999 Registration Statement"), to authorize the issuance of up to $2,500 in debt securities. In January 2001 the Company issued the remaining $700 of term notes under the 1999 Registration Statement. The $700 principal bears interest at 7.5% and matures February 15, 2011. Proceeds were used primarily to reduce borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program. In May 2000 the Company issued $500 of term notes under the 1999 Registration Statement. The notes are composed of $275 of principal bearing interest at 8.35% due May 1, 2010, and $225 of principal bearing interest at 8.7% due May 1, 2030. Proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program. In July 1999 the Company issued $1,300 of term notes under the 1999 Registration Statement. The notes are composed of $300 of principal bearing interest at 6.55% due August 1, 2004; $350 of principal bearing interest at 6.95% due August 1, 2009; and $650 of principal bearing interest at 7.45% due August 1, 2029. Proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program. In July 1999 the Company negotiated an amendment to a $200 term loan agreement between ASC and a group of commercial banks. The amended loans carry interest based upon a pricing schedule (which averages 6.45%) dependent upon the Company's long-term debt rating, and mature July 3, 2004. During 1998 Albertson's issued a total of $317 in medium-term notes under a $500 shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in December 1997. The remaining authorization of $183 under the 1997 shelf registration statement was rolled into the 1999 Registration Statement. Proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's commercial paper program. On March 19, 1998, ASC issued $45 of 6.5% notes due March 20, 2008, under an outstanding Series B Medium-term Note Program. On March 30, 1998, ASC issued an additional $100 of 7.1% notes due March 20, 2028, under the same program. Proceeds were used to refinance short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. The Company has pledged real estate with a cost of $161 as collateral for mortgage notes which are payable on various schedules, including interest at rates ranging from 6.8% to 16.5%. The notes mature from 2001 to 2019. Medium-term notes of $30 due July 2027 contain a put option which would require the Company to repay the notes in July 2007 if the holder of the note so elects by giving the Company a 60-day notice. Medium-term notes of $50 due April 2028 contain a put option which would require the Company to repay the notes in April 2008 if the holder of the note so elects by giving the Company a 60-day notice. The $200 of 7.5% debentures due 2037 contain a put option which will require the Company to repay the note in 2009 if the holder of the notes so elects by giving the Company a 60-day notice. Albertson's filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which became effective on February 13, 2001 ("2001 Registration Statement") to authorize the issuance of up to $3,000 in debt securities. The Company will use the net proceeds of any securities sold pursuant to the 2001 Registration Statement for retirement of debt and general corporate purposes including the potential purchase of outstanding shares of Albertson's common stock. No amounts have been issued pursuant to this registration statement. 19 Albertson's, Inc.  Net interest expense was as follows: The scheduled aggregate maturities of debt outstanding at February 1, 2001, are summarized as follows: $62 in 2001, $104 in 2002, $104 in 2003, $504 in 2004, $203 in 2005 and $4,800 thereafter. Capital Stock On December 2, 1996, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan, which was amended on August 2, 1998, and March 16, 1999, under which all stockholders receive one right for each share of common stock held. Each right will entitle the holder to purchase, under certain circumstances, one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "preferred stock") at a price of 160 dollars. Subject to certain exceptions, the rights will become exercisable for shares of preferred stock 10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by the Board of Directors) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock. Under the plan, subject to certain exceptions, if any person or group as defined by the plan becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock or takes certain other actions, each right will then entitle its holder as defined by the plan, other than such person or group, upon payment of the 160 dollars exercise price, to purchase common stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) with a value equal to twice the exercise price. The rights may be redeemed by the Board of Directors at a price of $0.001 per right under certain circumstances. The rights, which do not vote and are not entitled to dividends, will expire at the close of business on March 21, 2007, unless earlier redeemed or extended by the Board of Directors of the Company. In connection with the Merger, no person or group became the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the common stock. The Board of Directors adopted a program on March 2, 1998, which authorized the Company to purchase and retire up to 5 million shares of its common stock. On August 2, 1998, the Board of Directors rescinded the remaining authorization in connection with the Merger. The Board of Directors adopted a program on April 25, 2000, authorizing, but not requiring, the Company to purchase and retire up to $500 of the Company's common stock. This program was increased by an additional $1,000 by the Board of Directors on December 6, 2000, for a total of $1,500. The revised program enables the Company to purchase stock from April 25, 2000 through December 6, 2001. During fiscal 2000 the Company purchased and retired 18.7 million shares at a total cost of $451 or an average price of $24.15 per share. 20 Albertson's, Inc.  Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following: The change in the net deferred tax liability includes an adjustment related to stock options of $12. The Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $10 and $34, respectively, that will expire in years 2006 through 2021. Based on management's assessment, it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets associated with the net operating loss carryforwards will be realized; therefore, no valuation allowance is considered necessary. Income tax expense on continuing operations consists of the following: 21 Albertson's, Inc.  The reconciliations between the federal statutory tax rate and the Company's effective tax rates are as follows: Stock Options and Stock Awards The Company's stock option plans provide for the grant of options to purchase shares of common stock and stock awards. At February 1, 2001, Albertson's had one stock option plan in effect under which grants could be made with respect to 30 million shares of the Company's common stock. Under this plan, approved by the stockholders in 1998, options may be granted to officers and key employees to purchase the Company's common stock. During 1999, the Company's stock option plan was amended to, among other things, include the grant of options and other awards to non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Generally, options are granted with an exercise price at not less than 100% of the closing market price on the date of the grant. The Company's options generally become exercisable in installments of 20% per year on each of the first through fifth anniversaries of the grant date and have a maximum term of 10 years. In connection with the Merger, all outstanding options under prior Albertson's and ASC plans became exercisable in accordance with the change of control provisions included in the stock option plans and all outstanding ASC options were converted into a right to acquire an equivalent number of Albertson's shares. No further options will be granted under ASC plans. Additionally, all restrictions lapsed with respect to all outstanding stock awards under the ASC stock award plans. DEFERRED STOCK UNITS PLAN The Board of Directors adopted a program effective December 6, 2000, which authorized the award of 1,081,300 deferred stock units with dividend equivalents paid in cash quarterly under Albertson's, Inc. 1995 Amended and Restated Stock-Based Incentive Plan to key officers of the Company. Under this program, three-quarters of the units will be distributed in stock on December 5, 2003, if the officer is still employed by the Company on that date as an officer of the Company and one-quarter will be distributed in stock on December 5, 2003, if the preceding condition is met and the closing price of the Company's stock is at least $28.84 for at least 20 consecutive trading days at any time from December 6, 2000, through December 5, 2003. The Company is recognizing this expense over the three-year service period. VARIABLE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR OPTION PLANS The Company's stock option award plans contain provisions for automatic vesting upon a change of control. Under ASC plans, option holders had the right (limited stock appreciation right or LSAR), during an exercise period of up to 60 days after the occurrence of a change of control (but prior to consummation of the Merger), to elect to surrender all or part of their options in exchange for shares of Albertson's common stock having a value equal to the excess of the change of control price over the exercise price. Certain stock option plans of ASC defined change of control as the date of stockholder approval of the Merger. Approval of the Merger Agreement on November 12, 1998, by ASC's stockholders accelerated the vesting of 6.4 million equivalent stock options granted under pre-1997 ASC plans and permitted the holders of these options to exercise LSARs. The exercisability of the 6.4 million LSARs resulted in the Company recognizing a pre-tax $195 merger-related stock option charge during 1998. In the first quarter of 1999, a market price adjustment of $29 was recorded as a reduction of pre-tax merger-related costs to reflect a decline in the relevant stock price at the end of the first fiscal quarter relative to LSARs. The actual change of control price used to measure the value of these exercised LSARs became determinable at the date the Merger was consummated and resulted in no further adjustments. Upon Merger consummation, the change of control price was $53.77 per share, resulting in the issuance of approximately 1.7 million Albertson's shares. 22 Albertson's, Inc.  LSARs relating to approximately 4.0 million equivalent stock options became exercisable upon regulatory approval of the Merger, which resulted in recognition of an additional pre-tax charge of $76 in the second quarter of fiscal 1999. This charge was based upon a change of control price of $56.96 per share, which included an adjustment factor for the early termination of the LSAR feature. A total of 0.8 million Albertson's shares were issued in satisfaction of those options for which the LSAR feature was elected and the remaining options were converted into options to acquire approximately 1.2 million Albertson's shares. STOCK OPTIONS A summary of shares reserved for outstanding options as of the fiscal year end, changes during the year and related weighted average exercise price is presented below (shares in thousands, all ASC amounts included based upon the conversion ratio of 0.63 to 1):  21.78 12,536 39.76 159 40.39 Exercised (287) 21.54 (3,907) 33.00 (5,858) 29.16 Forfeited (1,121) 39.58 (603) 39.43 (839) 32.11 - ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------- Outstanding at end of year 25,290 $32.79 18,015 $38.34 9,989 $35.01  ============================================================================== ===================================== As of February 1, 2001, there were 5.5 million shares of Company common stock reserved for the granting of additional options and deferred stock units. The following table summarizes options outstanding and options exercisable as of February 1, 2001, and the related weighted average remaining contractual life (years) and weighted average exercise price (shares in thousands):  The weighted average fair value at date of grant for Albertson's options granted during 2000 and 1999 was $7.30 and $10.42 per option, respectively. Pre-merger Albertson's grants per option were $17.14 for 1998. Pre-merger ASC grants per option were $11.86 for 1998. The fair value of options at date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions: 23 Albertson's, Inc.  The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." Had compensation cost been determined based on the fair value at the grant date consistent with the provisions of this statement, the Company's pro forma net earnings and earnings per share would have been as follows: The 2000 pro forma net income of $738 resulted from reported net income of $765, less the 2000 pro forma after-tax compensation expense of $27. The 1999 pro forma income of $375 resulted from net income of $404, less the 1999 pro forma after-tax compensation expense of $67 ($49 of which related to an adjustment for the acceleration of unamortized compensation expense for the stock options granted prior to 1999 which vested in connection with the Merger) and the elimination of net merger-related after-tax stock option charges of $38 included with as- reported net earnings. The 1998 pro forma net income of $914 resulted from reported net income of $801, less the 1998 pro forma after-tax compensation expense of $19 and the elimination of the merger-related after-tax stock option charge of $132 included with as reported net earnings. The pro forma effect on net earnings is not representative of the pro forma effect on net earnings in future years. FORMER ASC PLANS The following ASC Plans were terminated in connection with the Merger on June 23, 1999. Performance Incentive Program The 1998 Performance Incentive Program provided certain of the ASC key executives an incentive award of shares of two-year restricted stock if certain ASC performance objectives were attained for the 1998 fiscal year. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The ASC Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which began January 1, 1996, enabled eligible employees of the Company to subscribe for shares of common stock on quarterly offering dates at a purchase price which was the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the shares on the first day or the last day of the quarterly offering period. Employee Benefit Plans Substantially all employees working over 20 hours per week are covered by retirement plans. Union employees participate in multi-employer retirement plans under collective bargaining agreements. The Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The Albertson's Salaried Employees Pension Plan and Albertson's Employees Corporate Pension Plan are funded, qualified, defined benefit, noncontributory plans for eligible Albertson's employees who are 21 years of age with one or more years of service and (with certain exceptions) are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Benefits paid to retirees are based upon age at retirement, years of credited service and average compensation. The Company's funding policy for these plans is to contribute the larger of the amount required to fully fund the Plan's current liability or the amount necessary to meet the funding requirements as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also sponsors the Albertson's Savings and Retirement Estates (ASRE) Plan (formerly the American Stores Retirement Estates Plan) which is a defined contribution retirement plan. ASRE was originally authorized by the ASC Board of Directors for the purpose of providing retirement benefits for employees of ASC and its subsidiaries. During 1999, ASRE was authorized by Albertson's Board of Directors to provide retirement benefits for all qualified employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. In conjunction with the authorization of ASRE, the Company-sponsored defined benefit plans were amended to close the plans to future new entrants. Future accruals for participants in the defined benefit plans are offset by the value of Company profit sharing contributions to the new defined contribution plan. 24 Albertson's, Inc.  The Company sponsors a tax-deferred savings plan which is a salary deferral plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan covers employees meeting age and service eligibility requirements, except those represented by a labor union, unless the collective bargaining agreement provides for participation. In addition, the Company provides a matching contribution based on the amount of eligible compensation contributed by the employee. All Company contributions to ASRE and the Company sponsored 401(k) plan are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The total amount contributed by the Company is included with the ASRE defined contribution plan expense. The Company also sponsors an unfunded Executive Pension Makeup Plan and an Executive ASRE Makeup Plan. These plans are nonqualified and provide certain key employees retirement benefits which supplement those provided by the Company's other retirement plans. Net periodic benefit (income) expense for defined benefit plans is determined using assumptions as of the beginning of each year. The projected benefit obligation and related funded status are determined using assumptions as of the end of each year. Assumptions used at the end of each year for the Company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans were as follows: Net periodic benefit (income) expense for Company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans was as follows: 25 Albertson's, Inc.  The following table sets forth the funded status of the Company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans: The following table summarizes the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation of the unfunded Executive Pension Makeup Plan: Assets of the two funded Company defined benefit pension plans are invested in directed trusts. Assets in the directed trusts are invested in common stocks (including $52 and $33 of the Company's common stock at February 1, 2001 and February 3, 2000, respectively), U.S. government obligations, corporate bonds, international equity funds, real estate and money market funds. 26 Albertson's, Inc.  The Company also contributes to various plans under industrywide collective bargaining agreements, primarily for defined benefit pension plans. Total contributions to these plans were $58 for 2000, $98 for 1999 and $100 for 1998. Retirement plans expense was as follows: Most retired employees of the Company are eligible to remain in its health and life insurance plans. Retirees who elect to remain in the Albertson's-sponsored plans are charged a premium which is equal to the difference between the estimated costs of the benefits for the retiree group and a fixed contribution amount made by the Company. The Company also provides certain health care benefits to eligible ASC retirees of certain defined employee groups under two unfunded plans, a defined dollar and a full coverage plan. The net periodic postretirement benefit cost was as follows: The following table sets forth the funded status of the Company-sponsored postretirement health and life insurance benefit plans: 27 Albertson's, Inc.  For measurement purposes, a 6% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for plans covering ASC retirees for 2000 and is expected to remain at that level thereafter. For the ASC defined dollar plan, no future increases in the subsidy level were assumed. Annual rates of increases in health care costs are not applicable in the calculation of the Albertson's benefit obligation because Albertson's contribution is a fixed amount per participant. With the exception of the plans covering ASC grandfathered retirees, all postretirement plans are contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually. The accounting for the health care plans anticipates that the Company will not increase its contribution for health care benefits for non-grandfathered retirees in future years. Since the subsidy levels for the Albertson's and the ASC defined dollar plans are fixed and the proportion of grandfathered ASC retirees is small, a health care cost trend increase or decrease has no material impact on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the postretirement benefit expense. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" requires employers to recognize an obligation for benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. The Company is self-insured for certain of its employees' short-term and long-term disability plans which are the primary benefits paid to inactive employees prior to retirement. Following is a summary of the obligation for postemployment benefits included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: The Company also contributes to various plans under industrywide collective bargaining agreements which provide for health care benefits to both active employees and retirees. Total contributions to these plans were $286 for 2000, $316 for 1999, and $270 for 1998. Employment Contract In December 2000 the Company entered into a severance agreement with the current Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, under which he will receive a severance payment of $3 upon his retirement from the Company (expected to occur in June 2001). He has agreed not to become employed by a competitor of the Company during the two-year period following his retirement and to cooperate with the Company in connection with certain routine matters. Leases The Company leases a portion of its real estate. The typical lease period is 20 to 30 years and most leases contain renewal options. Exercise of such options is dependent on the level of business conducted at the location. In addition, the Company leases certain equipment. Some leases contain contingent rental provisions based on sales volume at retail stores or miles traveled for trucks. Capitalized leases are calculated using interest rates appropriate at the inception of each lease. Following is an analysis of the Company's assets under capitalized leases: 28 Albertson's, Inc.  Future minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases which exclude the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments, related subleases and capital leases at February 1, 2001, were as follows: The Company is contingently liable as a guarantor of certain leases that were assigned to third parties in connection with various store closures and dispositions. The Company believes the likelihood of a significant loss from these agreements is remote because of the wide dispersion among third parties and remedies available to the Company should the primary party fail to perform under the agreements. Rent expense under operating leases, excluding the amortization of acquisition- related fair value adjustments of $14 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, was as follows: Financial Instruments Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and receivables. The Company limits the amount of credit exposure to each individual financial institution and places its temporary cash into investments of high credit quality. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to their dispersion across various companies and geographies. The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term debt, commercial paper and bank line borrowings approximate their carrying amounts. Substantially all of the fair values were estimated using quoted market prices. The estimated fair values and carrying amounts of outstanding debt (excluding commercial paper and bank line borrowings) were as follows: 29 Albertson's, Inc.  Environmental The Company has identified environmental contamination sites related primarily to underground petroleum storage tanks and ground water contamination at various store, warehouse, office and manufacturing facilities (related to current operations as well as previously disposed of businesses). The Company conducts an ongoing program for the inspection and evaluation of new sites proposed to be acquired by the Company and the remediation/monitoring of contamination at existing and previously owned sites. Undiscounted reserves have been established for each environmental contamination site unless an unfavorable outcome is remote. Although the ultimate outcome and expense of environmental remediation is uncertain, the Company believes that required remediation and continuing compliance with environmental laws, in excess of current reserves, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company. Charges against earnings for environmental remediation were not material in 2000, 1999 or 1998. Legal Proceedings On August 23, 2000, a class action complaint was filed against Jewel Food Stores, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois (Maureen Baker, et al., v. Jewel Food Stores, Inc. and Dominick's Supermarkets, Inc., Case No. 00L 009664) alleging milk price fixing. The Company has strong defenses against this lawsuit, and is vigorously defending it. Although this lawsuit is subject to the uncertainties inherent in the litigation process, based on the information presently available to the Company, management does not expect the ultimate resolution of this action to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition. An agreement has been reached, and court approval granted, to settle eight purported multi-state cases combined in the United States District Court in Boise, Idaho, which raise various issues including "off the clock" work allegations. Under the settlement agreement, current and former employees who meet eligibility criteria are in the process of presenting their claims to a settlement administrator. While the Company cannot specify the exact amount of their claims, the $37 pre-tax ($22 after-tax) one-time charge recorded by the Company in 1999 is the Company's current estimate of the total monetary liability, including attorney fees, for all eight cases. The Company is also involved in routine litigation incidental to operations. The Company utilizes various methods of alternative dispute resolution, including settlement discussions, to manage the costs and uncertainties inherent in the litigation process. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition. Segment Information In June 1997 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," which establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise's operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company has analyzed the reporting requirements of the standard and has determined that its operations are within a single operating segment. All of the Company's operations are within the United States. Recent Accounting Standard In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. This new standard as amended establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 effective February 2, 2001. The Company has completed its evaluation of this standard and its impact on the Company's accounting and reporting requirements and management does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. 30 Albertson's, Inc.

Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for American Stores Company for 1998, is based solely on the report of such other auditors. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Albertson's, Inc., and subsidiaries at February 1, 2001 and February 3, 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP -------------------------- Deloitte & Touche LLP Boise, Idaho March 19, 2001 31 Albertson's, Inc.

Responsibility for Financial Reporting The management of Albertson's, Inc., is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the management of the Company, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, using management's best estimates and judgment where necessary. Financial information appearing throughout this Annual Report is consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements. To help fulfill its responsibility, management maintains a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorizations and are reflected accurately in the Company's records. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that the cost of maintaining a system of internal accounting controls should not exceed benefits expected to be derived from the system. The Company believes that its long-standing emphasis on the highest standards of conduct and ethics, set forth in comprehensive written policies, serves to reinforce its system of internal controls. Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors, audited the consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America to independently assess the fair presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed entirely of outside directors, oversees the fulfillment by management of its responsibilities over financial controls and the preparation of financial statements. The Audit Committee meets with internal and external auditors at least four times per year to review audit plans and audit results. This provides internal and external auditors direct access to the Board of Directors. Management recognizes its responsibility to conduct the business of Albertson's, Inc., in accordance with high ethical standards. This responsibility is reflected in key policy statements that, among other things, address potentially conflicting outside business interests of Company employees and specify proper conduct of business activities. Ongoing communications and review programs are designed to help ensure compliance with these policies. /s/ Gary G. Michael /s/ A.

The following table reflects the net earnings (loss) and earnings per share (EPS) effect of these items. The Company estimates the quarterly LIFO reserves, which cannot be accurately determined until year end. The LIFO method of valuing inventories (decreased) increased net earnings and EPS as follows: Due to rounding and different periods used to compute weighted average outstanding shares, the sum of the quarterly EPS may not equal the annual EPS. 35 Albertson's, Inc.
