Documents incorporated by reference: The Company's Proxy Statement for the annual meeting of the Company's shareholders to be held on December 4, 1997. (See Part III herein). PART I Item 1. Business The Company, which was incorporated in 1947, is primarily engaged in the marketing of fine and industrial chemicals used principally in the agricultural, color producing, pharmaceutical and surface coating industries. The Company sells over 600 chemicals used in these and other fields. Most of the chemicals distributed by the Company are purchased abroad mainly for sale throughout the United States; to a minor extent, some chemicals are sold abroad. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 approximately 50% of the Company's purchases of chemicals came from Europe and approximately 35% from Asia. There were no significant changes in the kinds of products sold by the Company or in the markets served or methods of distribution used by it. The chemical industry is highly competitive. Most of the chemicals that the Company sells are in competition with the products of chemical manufacturers, including the largest chemical companies, who have substantially greater resources than the Company. However, in the Company's opinion, based on reports from its customers and suppliers, its competitive position is enhanced by the following: the chemical products that it offers are prime quality products, many produced by major chemical companies, some of whom are the largest chemical companies in Europe and Asia, which products are offered by the Company at attractive and competitive prices. For the most part the Company warehouses the inventories of the chemicals which it sells at public warehouses strategically located throughout the United States, and can therefore fill orders rapidly from inventory. The Company has developed ready access to key purchasing, research and technical executives of both its customers and suppliers, and therefore one of its salient competitive strengths is its ability to obtain quick decisions, when necessary, because of such access. The technical support and services that the Company provides to its customers is also a strength. The Company does not consider itself to be a significant factor in the chemical industry taken as a whole. During fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 and 1996, no single chemical product accounted for as much as 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues; and no sales to any one customer accounted for as much as 10% of the Company's sales. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995, one bulk pharmaceutical chemical product accounted for 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues and sales of said product to Baker Norton Pharmaceuticals, Inc. accounted for 10% of the Company's sales. During fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995, one of the Company's suppliers accounted for 22%, 25% and 20% of total purchases, respectively. Certain of the chemicals purchased by the Company are supplied to it on an exclusive basis, including the aforementioned bulk pharmaceutical product. Based on its relationships with its vendors, the Company believes its vendors will continue to supply such chemicals on an exclusive basis. The Company holds no patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises or concessions which it considers to be material to its operations. Sales of certain of the Company's chemicals are higher in the last six months of the fiscal year. For the most part, the Company warehouses the products that it sells and fills orders from inventory. It, therefore, does not consider information concerning backlogs to be applicable. A subsidiary of the Company markets certain agricultural chemicals and contracts for the manufacture of other agricultural chemicals which are subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). FIFRA requires that test data be provided to the Evironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to register, obtain and maintain approved labels for pesticide products. The EPA requires that follow-on registrants of these products compensate the initial registrant for the cost of producing the necessary test data on a basis prescribed in the FIFRA regulations. Follow-on registrants do not themselves generate or contract for the data. However, when FIFRA requirements mandate the generation of new test data to enable all registrants to continue marketing a pesticide product, often both the initial and follow-on registrants establish a task force to jointly undertake the testing effort. The Company is presently a member of two such task force groups. The Company estimates the cost of test data at the time it is first required, which estimates are amortized over a period of up to five years, updated annually; and are included in cost of sales. Liability under FIFRA would arise if the Company failed to compensate the initial registrant for the cost of producing the necessary test data. Since the Company markets no pesticide products which are not registered, and compensates initial registrants for the cost of producing test data, it believes it does not subject itself to contingent liabilities in such regard. Compliance with Federal, State and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment will have no material effect on the capital expenditures and competitive position of the Company. During fiscal 1993 the Company announced the closing of its manufacturing subsidiary located in Carlstadt, New Jersey. At the same time an environmental consultant was engaged by the Company to determine the extent of contamination on the site and develop a plan of remediation. Based on the initial estimates from the consultant a liability was established in fiscal 1993 for $1.5 million. During fiscal 1997, after additional testing was completed, the company received a revised estimate from the consultant. As a result, the company recorded an additional liability of $800,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 1996. At June 30, 1997 the remaining liability was $1.4 million. The company believes it is possible that such amount may not be sufficient to cover future environmental remediation but does not believe there will be a material adverse effect on the financial position or liquidity of the company. However, depending on the amount and timing of any required remediation over and above the liability established, it is possible that the company's future results could be materially affected in a particular reporting period. Other than the aforementioned remediation, the company is not aware of any material environmental liabilities. At June 30, 1997, the Company employed approximately 75 persons, none of whom were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Item 2. Properties The Company's general headquarters and main sales office occupy approximately 20,000 square feet of leased space in a modern office building in Lake Success, New York. The present lease expires in April 2001. The Company's former manufacturing facility is located on an 11-acre parcel in Carlstadt, New Jersey, owned by the Company. This parcel contains one building with approximately 5,000 square feet of office space. The property is held for sale. The Company owns two parcels in Long Island City, New York totaling 10,000 square feet. Both parcels are held for sale. In January, 1997 the Company sold a parcel it owned in Long Island City, New York. This parcel was comprised of a 5,000 square foot building. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. (None) Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders. (None) PART II Item 5. Market for the Company's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters. The Company's common stock is traded in the National Market System of NASDAQ (Symbol: ACET) and was quoted at prices  ranging as follows: FISCAL 1997 HIGH LOW First Quarter 15 3/4 12 1/4 Second Quarter 14 1/2 12 3/4 Third Quarter 14 1/2 12 1/2 Fourth Quarter 15 12 3/4 FISCAL 1996 HIGH LOW First Quarter 14 3/8 13 Second Quarter 16 3/8 14 1/4 Third Quarter 17 1/2 15 1/4 Fourth Quarter 17 1/2 15  The above prices represent high and low prices for actual transactions. A 10% stock dividend was paid in January 1996. The above prices have been adjusted  for this dividend, as appropriate. Cash dividends of $0.18 per common share were paid in January and June of both the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 and 1996. As of September 1, 1997, there were approximately 800 holders of record of the Company's Common Stock. Item 6.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. The Company's primary source of liquidity is cash provided from operating activities; $5.6 million in fiscal 1997 and $12.4 million in fiscal 1996. Cash and short-term investments totaled $14.2 and $16.0 million and working capital was $48.9 and $50.9 million at June 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively. In addition, the Company's long-term investments totaled $11.2 and $12.7 million for the same periods. These investments are highly liquid and can be used for working capital if needed. The Company has sufficient lines of credit available with banks, should any additional funds be required. The Company's stock buyback program resulted in the repurchase of 552,000 shares for $7.4 million during fiscal 1997 and 171,000 shares for $2.6 million during fiscal 1996. In June 1996 the Company discontinued operations and sold certain assets of its subsidiary, Pfaltz & Bauer, Inc. This closure, along with the prior closings of the Company's two manufacturing facilities, has reduced the need for capital expenditures. The former site of Arsynco, Inc., one of the closed manufacturing facilities, will require environmental remediation. In October 1996 the Company's environmental consultant completed its investigation of the property and estimated a cost of $1.5 million to complete the remediation. In the quarter ended September 30, 1996 the Company increased the current environmental remediation liability by $800,000 thereby adjusting the liability to the revised estimate. In 1993 the Company initially recorded an environmental liability of $1.5 million and through September 30, 1996 had expended $800,000 for testing, evaluation and remediation of the property. Any funds required for additional stock buybacks, capital expenditures or environmental remediation will be funded by the aforementioned sources of liquidity. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. In fiscal 1997, net sales decreased by 8%, to $169.4 million. Lower sales of agricultural chemicals and bulk pharmaceuticals to the generic drug industry, partially offset by increased sales of intermediates used in the manufacture of dyes, pigments and pharmaceuticals accounted for the decrease. The volume of products sold decreased by 6%, slightly less than the corresponding sales decrease. While selling prices in general remained stable, the decrease in sales of bulk pharmaceuticals, which tend to be higher priced, accounted for this disparity. The increase in net sales of 11%, to $183.2 million, in fiscal 1996 compared to 1995 was due to higher sales of specialty chemical intermediates used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements and industrial chemicals. In fiscal 1996, selling prices were relatively stable and volumes were only marginally higher than the previous year. Gross profit margins decreased to 12.6% in fiscal 1997 down from 13.0% in fiscal 1996 and 15.1% in fiscal 1995. Increased competition in the dye and pigment intermediates business was responsible for the decrease in 1997 from 1996. The decrease in 1996 from 1995 was caused by increased competition in many areas of business, as well as higher sales of a marginally profitable herbicide in 1996. Selling, general and administrative expenses were down 5% in fiscal 1997 compared to 1996. Several components increased, including the cost of medical insurance, selling expenses, legal expense and consulting fees. These increases were more than offset by the elimination of selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.3 million from the Company's former Pfaltz & Bauer, Inc. subsidiary. The decrease of 3% in fiscal 1996 compared to fiscal 1995 was due to decreases in insurance and telecommunications costs, along with a non-recurring expense of $400,000 in 1995 relating to the preparation for sale of Pfaltz & Bauer, Inc. These decreases were partially offset by increases in compensation and selling expenses. Interest expense, which primarily relates to long-term debt, was $110,000, $157,000 and $196,000 in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The interest on long-term debt continues to decline as scheduled payments reduce the principal balance. Other income increased to $2.5 million in fiscal 1997 compared to $1.5 million in fiscal 1996. There were many factors that accounted for this $1.0 million increase. The sale of property held by a subsidiary resulted in a $200,000 gain. In conjunction with the aforementioned sale of a subsidiary in June of 1996, inventory was transferred to the new ownership and the Company has received and will continue to be entitled to a portion of the proceeds from the sale of this inventory for a period of up to three years from the date of transfer. This totaled $170,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997. Also, relating to this transaction, the Company earned approximately $70,000 in interest on two notes. Royalty income increased by $100,000 and higher average cash balances available for investment resulted in an increase of $130,000 in interest income. During fiscal 1996 a loss of $250,000 was realized on the sale of certain assets of Pfaltz & Bauer, Inc. The decrease in fiscal 1996 to $1.5 million from $1.8 million in fiscal 1995 was due to the aforementioned loss of $250,000 in fiscal 1996, along with slightly lower investment rates. The effective tax rates were 38.9%, 39.4% and 38.5% in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. All three years were not affected by any unusual tax circumstances and approximated the Company's traditional effective tax rate. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement 128, "Earnings per Share" ("Statement 128"). Statement 128 establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share ("EPS"). The statement simplifies the standards for computing EPS and makes them comparable to international EPS standards. The provisions of Statement 128 are effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after December 15, 1997, including interim periods. The statement does not permit early application and requires restatement of all prior period EPS data presented. Adoption of Statement 128 will not materially affect the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or previously reported EPS data. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The financial statements required by this item 8 are set forth at the end of this report.

Independent Auditors' Report The Board of Directors Aceto Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aceto Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 1997. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule II as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aceto Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1997 and 1996 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule II, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements tak  en as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Aceto Corporation and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995 (Dollars in thousands except amounts and par value per share) (1) Description of Business The Company is primarily engaged in the marketing of fine and industrial chemicals used principally in the agricultural, color producing, pharmaceutical and surface coating industries. Most of the chemicals distributed by the Company are purchased abroad mainly for sale throughout the United States; to a minor extent, some chemicals are sold abroad. (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aceto Corporation and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the time goods are sold and shipped. Inventory Inventory consists of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost (principally on a specific identification basis) or market (net realizable value). Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company depreciates property and equipment using sum-of-the-years and declining balance methods. The range of estimated useful lives are as follows: Computers 5 years Furniture and fixtures 10 years Automobiles 3 years Property Held for Sale Property held for sale is stated at cost. Buildings included in the property held for sale are depreciated using the straight-line method over twenty years. Impairment, if any, is recognized if the estimated fair value less costs to sell is lower than the carrying value. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Income Per Common and Common Equivalent Share Income per common and common equivalent share is determined based on the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding for the period. Weighted average common shares outstanding for fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995 were 4,972,000, 5,299,000 and 5,545,000, respectively, after giving retroactive effect to the 10% stock dividend paid in January 1996 and included common stock equivalents of 46,000, 62,000 and 63,000, respectively. Shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of preferred stock were excluded from the computation since they were not materially dilutive during the three year period. Cash and Cash Equivalents There were no cash equivalents at June 30, 1997 and 1996. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Marketable Investment Securities Investments at June 30, 1997 and 1996 consisted of U.S. Treasury, corporate debt and equity securities, and municipal obligations. The Company classifies its debt and equity securities as either trading or held-to-maturity securities. Trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the short term. Held-to-maturity are those securities in which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. In determining realized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Trading securities were recorded at their fair market value of $3,301 and $2,866 at June 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively, and were classified as short-term investments. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at cost and are adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts over the life of the related security. The cost of held-to-maturity securities approximated their fair market value. Held-to-maturity securities at June 30, 1997 and 1996 consisted of: Due after Due in one year less than through one year three years 1997 1996 1997 1996 U.S. Treasury securities $1,989 $1,994 $ 999 $ 1,967 Corporate debt securities 3,548 4,763 10,213 10,770 Municipal obligations 1,175 972 --- --- $6,712 $7,729 $11,212 $12,737 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of all financial instruments classified as a current asset or current liability are deemed to approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of foreign currency contracts (used for hedging purposes) was estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers and the difference between the fair value and contract value was immaterial (See note 11c). The difference between the fair value of long-term financial instruments and their carrying value at June 30, 1997 and 1996 was not material. The fair value of the Company's long- term debt and notes receivable were based upon current rates for similar financial instruments offered to the Company. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of", on July 1, 1996. This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Stock Options Prior to July 1, 1996 the Company accounted for its stock option plan in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", and related interpretations. As such, compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant only if and to the extent that the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. On July 1, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("Statement 123"), which permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting period the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant. Alternatively, Statement 123 also allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in the prior year and future years as if the fair-value-based method defined in Statement 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of Statement 123. (3) Debt and Financing Arrangements (a) Long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 1997 and 1996 was as follows: 1997 1996 Note payable to the Prudential Insurance Company of America in equal semi-annual installments of $250 maturing Jan. 1, 1999, plus interest at 9.10% payable quarterly. $ 750 $1,250 Less current installments 250 250 $ 500 $1,000 (b) The agreement underlying the long-term debt contains certain defined restrictive covenants, including limitations on corporate acquisitions and mergers and additional debt, minimum working capital and debt/equity ratios and the acquisition of the Company's stock. (c) At June 30, 1997 and 1996 the Company had available two lines of credit with financial institutions totaling $13,000. The credit arrangements do not: (i) restrict withdrawals of funds; (ii) have a formal requirement relating to compensating balances for either credit utilized or available; or (iii) provide for commitment fees. However, there are informal arrangements under which the Company maintains compensating balances. The compensating balance arrangements at June 30, 1997   and for the year then ended were satisfied by collected balances. There were no short-term loans outstanding under the lines of credit at any time during the three year period ended June 30, 1997. The lines of credit can be withdrawn by the financial institutions at any time. (4) Income Taxes The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to a significant portion of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at June 30, 1997 and 1996 are presented below: 1997 1996 Deferred tax assets: Accrued environmental remediation liabilities not currently deductible $ 555 $ 316 Accrued compensation 468 450 Additional costs inventoried for tax purposes pursuant to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 156 234 Allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 88 83 Other -- 42 Net deferred tax asset $ 1,267 $ 1,125 Deferred tax liabilities: Differences in depreciation of property and equipment $ (14) $ (14) In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to fully realize the deferred tax asset, the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $3,300. Taxable income for the years ended June 30, 1997 and 1996 was approximately $9,900 and $12,800, respectively. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. Reconciliation of the statutory Federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995 was as follows: 1997 1996 1995 Federal statutory tax rate 34.0% 34.0% 34.0% State and local taxes, net of Federal income tax benefit 3.4 3.9 3.9 Other 1.5 1.5 0.6 Effective tax rate 38.9% 39.4% 38.5% (5) Redeemable Preferred Stock The Company has 2,000,000 authorized shares of redeemable preferred stock with a par value of $2.50 per share. The stock is redeemable at the option of either the holder or issuer at par. All of the outstanding preferred stock is held by the Aceto Corporation Profit Sharing Plan. Redeemable preferred stock outstanding at both June 30, 1997 and 1996 consisted of the following: Shares Par Value Third series 100,000 $250 Fourth series 40,000 100 Fifth series 40,000 100 Sixth series 40,000 100 Seventh series 40,000 100 Eighth series 40,000 100 $750 The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth series of preferred stock are convertible beginning on the date of issue into the Company's common stock at ratios of 6.4, 6.4, 5.1, 6.0, 6.0 and 4.2 shares of preferred stock to 1 share of common stock, respectively, subject to antidilution provisions. The third and sixth series pay 10%, the fourth and fifth series pay 8%, the seventh series pays 9.5% and the eighth series pays 9% annual cumulative cash dividends on par value. All series have voting rights. In the event of liquidation of the Company, all series share ratably in the remaining proceeds. On April 9, 1996 the Aceto Corporation Profit Sharing Plan converted 28,000 shares of second series preferred stock of Aceto Corporation into 11,000 shares of Aceto Corporation common stock. (6) Supplemental Cash Flow Information Cash paid for interest and income taxes during the years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995 was as follows: 1997 1996 1995 Interest $ 110 $ 156 $ 196 Income taxes 5,024 3,736 4,762 In June, 1997, the Company received a note in the amount of $206 in connection with the sale of a building and land. In June 1996, the Company received notes aggregating $635 in connection with the sale of certain assets and real property. (see note 10) (7) Stock Option Plan (a) Under the Company's 1980 stock option plan, the option prices are determined by the Board of Directors and can be greater or less than the market value of the stock on the date the options are granted. These options become exercisable in whole or in part, as determined by the Board of Directors, beginning on the date of grant, and must be exercised no later than five or ten years, depending on the terms at the date of grant, after the date they become exercisable. Through June 30, 1997, options were granted to officers and key employees who own less than 10% of the Company's stock. At June 30, 1997, options to purchase 9,000 shares were available for grant. (b) The following tabulations summarize the shares of common stock under option at June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995 as adjusted only for stock dividends, if any, occurring in that year, and the activity with respect to options for the respective years then ended. Weighted No. of average exercise shares price per share Shares under option and exercisable: June 30, 1997 152,000 $10.86 June 30, 1996 122,000 9.70 June 30, 1995 110,000 8.41 Shares under option but not exercisable: June 30, 1997 200,000 $12.77 June 30, 1996 106,000 11.67 June 30, 1995 -- -- Options granted during years ended: June 30, 1997 150,000 $13.39 June 30, 1996 146,000 11.91 June 30, 1995 13,000 12.50 Options exercised during years ended: June 30, 1997 19,000 $ 7.29 June 30, 1996 36,000 6.15 June 30, 1995 45,000 5.72 At June 30, 1997, the weighted average option price for the 352,000 option shares outstanding under the 1980 stock option plan was $11.94 with expiration dates ranging from December 31, 1997 to December 31, 2013. Options cancelled during fiscal 1997 and 1996 were 8,000 and 1,000, respectively. No options were cancelled during fiscal 1995. (c) Under the Company's 1980 stock option plan, upon exercise of options, the excess of the option price over the par value is credited to capital in excess of par value. When treasury stock is issued upon the exercise of options, the difference between the option price and the cost of treasury stock is recorded in capital in excess of par value. Under the plan, during the period options become exercisable, compensation is charged to operations for the excess of fair market value over the option price at the date of grant. Such charges to operations were $121, $128 and $86 in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during 1997 and 1996 was $4.34 and $5.78, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: Risk-free Date Expected Expected interest Dividend of grant volatility(%) life(years) rate(%) yield(%) 1997 1/24/97 20 5.0 6.19 2.62 6/05/97 20 13.4 6.52 2.67 1996 1/29/96 20 5.0 5.18 2.25 1/29/96 20 6.8 5.24 2.25 3/20/96 20 6.8 5.93 2.34 The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its stock option grants and, accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in the financial statements for its stock options which have an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the stock on the date of the grant. Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options under Statement No. 123, the Company's net income and income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below: 1997 1996 Net income: As reported $6,228 $7,154 Pro forma 6,145 6,943 Income per share: As reported $ 1.24 $ 1.34 Pro forma 1.22 1.30 Summarized information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 1997 is as follows: Outstanding Exercisable Exercise price Number Average Average Number Average range of life(1) price(2) of price shares shares (2) $ 5-$10 36,000 2.0 $ 6.89 36,000 $ 6.89 $11-$15 316,000 8.5 $12.57 116,000 $12.22 (1)Weighted average contractual life remaining, in years. (2)Weighted average exercise price. (8) Interest and Other Income Interest and other income earned during the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995 were comprised of the following: 1997 1996 1995 Dividends $ 19 $ 14 $ 20 Interest 1,595 1,469 1,547 Net gain (loss)on investments 105 44 (5) Net gain (loss)on sale of assets 198 (243) - Royalty income 248 143 119 Misc. other income 331 95 143 $2,496 $1,522 $1,824 (9) Environmental Remediation It is the policy of the Company to accrue and charge against earnings environmental remediation costs at the time it is determined that a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. During fiscal 1993 the Company announced the closing of its manufacturing subsidiary located in Carlstadt, New Jersey. At the same time an environmental consultant was engaged by the Company to determine the extent of contam  ination on the site and develop a plan of remediation. Based on the initial estimates from the consultant a liability was established in fiscal 1993 for $1,500. During fiscal 1997 after additional testing was completed, the Company received a revised estimate from the consultant. As a result, the Company recorded an additional liability of $800 in the quarter ended September 30, 1996. At June 30, 1997 the remaining liability was $1,400. The Company believes it is possible that such amount may not be sufficient to cover future environmental remediation but does not believe there will be a material adverse effect on the financial position or liquidity of the Company. However, depending on the amount and timing of any required remediation over and above the liability established, it is possible that the Company's future results could be materially affected in a particular reporting period. Other than the aforementioned remediation, the Company is not aware of any material environmental liabilities. (10) Notes Receivable In June, 1997 a subsidiary of the Company sold real property and received a ten year note, payable monthly, in the amount of $206, maturing in June 2007, bearing interest at 9.5%. This note is secured by a first mortgage on the property. In connection with this sale, the Company recorded a $198 gain. In June 1996, the Company sold certain assets and real property of its Pfaltz & Bauer, Inc. subsidiary for $726, which included two notes receivable aggregating $635. One note, in the amount of $460, matures in July 2021 and bears interest at 9.25%. The other note, in the amount of $175, matures in June 2003 and bears interest at prime plus 1%. The note for $460 is payable monthly and is secured by a first mortgage on the real property. The note for $175 is payable quarterly beginning in June 1999 and is collateralized by a security interest in the assets sold and contract rights. In connection with this sale of assets, the Company recorded a $247 loss. In connection with the sale of assets, the Company agreed to maintain $275 of unencumbered funds for a period of seven years from the date of sale to secure the purchaser's rights and the Company's obligations under the terms of the agreement, including indemnification for certain environmental matters, if any arise. The unencumbered balance could be reduced to $100 if certain environmental certifications were obtained. These certifications were received in September, 1996 and, therefore, the unencumbered balance was reduced accordingly. The payments on the notes are also subject to the purchaser's rights of set off as provided in the agreement which is identical to those affecting the unencumbered funds. The Company holds a ten-year note maturing in October 2003 in the amount of $256 secured by a first mortgage on the real property it sold in September 1993. This note is payable monthly with interest at prime plus 3% through September 1996 and prime plus 2 1/2% for the balance of the term. (11) Profit-Sharing Plans The Company has profit-sharing plans in which employees of the parent company and subsidiaries are eligible to participate. The Company's annual contribution per employee, which is at management's discretion, is based on a percentage of compensation paid. The Company's provisions for profit sharing contribution amounted to $607, $664 and $668 in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. (12) Commitments and Contingencies (a) A subsidiary of the Company markets certain agricultural chemicals which are subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). FIFRA requires that test data be provided to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to register, obtain and maintain approved labels for pesticide products. The EPA requires that follow-on companys of these products compensate the initial company for the cost of producing the necessary test data on a basis prescribed in the FIFRA regulations. Follow-on companys do not themselves generate or contract for the data. However, when FIFRA requirements mandate the generation of new test data to enable all company's to continue marketing a pesticide product, often both the initial and follow-on companys establish a task force to jointly undertake the testing effort. The Company is presently a member of two such task force groups. The Company estimates the cost of test data at the time it is first required, which estimates are amortized over a period of up to five years, updated annually, and are included in cost of sales. Liability under FIFRA would arise if the Company marketed pesticide products not registered under FIFRA, or failed to compensate the initial company for the cost of producing the necessary test data. Since the Company markets no pesticide products which are not registered, and compensates initial companys for the cost of producing test data, it believes it does not subject itself to contingent liabilities in such regard. (b) The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims which have arisen in the normal course of their business. The impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company's results of operations or liquidity in a particular reporting period is not known. Management is of the opinion, however, that the ultimate outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition. (c) The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts entirely as hedges relating to foreign inventory purchase commitments. These financial instruments are designed to minimize exposure and reduce risk from exchange rate fluctuations in the regular course of business. Gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. At June 30, 1997 the Company had contracts maturing at various dates through April 10, 1998 to purchase approximately $11,300 in foreign currencies (primarily British Pounds, Belgian Francs, German Marks and Japanese Yen). (d) At June 30, 1997, the Company had non-negotiated letters of credit to purchase merchandise of approximately $7,500, which approximated the fair value of the merchandise. (e) The Company currently leases an office facility under an operating lease expiring April 2001. At June 30, 1997, future minimum lease payments in the aggregate and for each of the five succeeding years are as follows: Fiscal year ending June 30 Amount 1998 $ 555 1999 555 2000 555 2001 440 2002 - $2,105 Total rental expense relating to the current office facility amounted to approximately $480 for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 1997. (13) Segment Information The Company's operations, which principally consist of the marketing of chemicals, are considered to be one industry segment as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 14. (14) Business and Credit Concentrations None of the Company's customers accounted for as much as 10% of revenues in fiscal 1997 and 1996. One of the Company's customers accounted for 10% of revenues in fiscal 1995. One of the Company's suppliers accounted for 22%, 25% and 20% of total purchases in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of trade receivables. The Company's customers are dispersed across many industries and are located primarily in the United States. The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the creditworthiness of its customers as well as general economic conditions. Consequently, an adverse change in those factors could affect the Company's estimate of its bad debts. The Company as a policy does not require collateral from its customers, however it maintains credit insurance covering certain non- United States receivables.
