This  Company's shares are only issued to and held by, its dealer-stockholders. All shares held by these stockholders can be  repurchased by the Company when the dealer-stockholder's membership agreement terminates. Thus, there is no market for  these shares. The repurchase price for each share of Class A Stock is equal to the par value of $1,000 per share. The  repurchase of Class B Stock is equal to twice the par value or $2,000 per share. The repurchase price for each share of Class  C Stock is equal to the par value of $100. As of February 17, 2003, the aggregate value of the Class A Stock, Class B Stock  and Class C Stock held by non-affiliates (dealer-stockholders) calculated on the basis of this repurchase price was  $275,876,900.             Indicate by check mark whether the Registrant (1) has filed all reports required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the Registrant was required  to file such reports), and (2) has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days.        Yes _ __X _     No _    _             Indicate by check mark if disclosure of delinquent filers pursuant to Item 405 of Regulation S-K is not contained herein  and will not be contained to the best of Registrant's knowledge, in definitive proxy or information statements incorporated in  Part III of this Form 10-K or any amendment to this Form 10-K.             Indicate by check mark whether the Registrant is an accelerated filer (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Act).        Yes _ X  _No _     _             Indicate the number of shares outstanding of each of the Registrant's classes of common stock, as of the latest practicable  date (applicable only to corporation Registrants).

Business                The terms "Ace," "cooperative," "we," "us," "our" and similar words refer to Ace Hardware Corporation. The terms  "member," "retailer," "dealer," "you," "your" and similar words refer to someone who purchases our stock.             Ace Hardware Corporation was formally organized as a Delaware corporation in 1964. In 1973, as the result of a  corporate merger, it became the successor of Ace Hardware Corporation, an Illinois corporation that was organized in 1928.  Until 1973, the Illinois corporation conducted the business now being engaged in by Ace. Our main executive offices are  located at 2200 Kensington Court, Oak Brook, Illinois 60523. Our main telephone number is (630) 990-6600. Our Internet  site address is http://www.acehardware.com. We make available free of charge our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K as soon as reasonably practicable after we file with or furnish such  documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission.             We operate primarily as a wholesaler of hardware and related products, and we also manufacture paint products. We  mainly sell our products to hardware dealers who have Membership Agreements with us. These Membership Agreements  allow the hardware dealers to purchase merchandise and services from us and, in most cases, to license one or more of our  trademarks. (See the heading "Business  " , subheading "Membership Agreements").             We operate on a cooperative basis and distribute patronage dividends to our eligible member dealers each year on the  basis of quantity or value of patronage business that we do with them. (See the heading "Business  " , subheading "Distribution  of Patronage Dividends").             As of the end of our 2002 fiscal year on December 28, 2002, there were 4,909 stores having Membership Agreements  with us. The States with the largest concentration of members are California (approximately 10%), Texas and Illinois  (approximately 6% each), Florida (approximately 5%) and Michigan and Georgia (approximately 4% each). The States where  we shipped the largest percentages of merchandise in fiscal year 2002 were California (approximately 13%), Illinois  (approximately 7%), Florida (approximately 6%), Texas, Michigan and Georgia (approximately 4% each). Approximately  4.0% of our merchandise sales were made to locations outside of the United States and its territories in fiscal 2002.             The number of member locations that we had during each of our past three fiscal years is summarized in the following  table:                                    _2002_         _2001_        _2000_            Member outlets at beginning of period 4,976         5,011        5,082          New member outlets 181           220           208          Member outlets terminated _   248_        _   255_         _  279  _          Member outlets at end of period 4,909        4,976        5,011                                                                     ==== ====       ====          Dealers having one or more member outlets at end of period 3,673        3,778        3,858             We service our dealers by buying merchandise in quantity lots, mainly from manufacturers. We then warehouse large  quantities of this merchandise and sell it in smaller lots to our dealers. Most of the products that we distribute to our members  from our warehouses are sold at a price that we establish ("dealer cost"), to which a 10% adder ("handling charge") is  generally added. In fiscal year 2002, warehouse sales were 72% of our merchandise sales and bulletin sales were 4% of our  merchandise sales with the balance of 24% being direct shipment sales.             The following is a breakdown of our total warehouse sales for merchandise purchases among various general classes of  merchandise for each of the past three fiscal years:             _  Class of Merchandise  _   _2002_          _2001_          _2000_            Paint, cleaning and related supplies 22%            21%            20%          Plumbing and heating supplies 15%            15%            15%          Hand and power tools 13%            14%            14%          Garden, rural equipment and related supplies 15%            14%            14%          Electrical supplies 11%            12%            12%          General hardware 11%            11%            12%          Sundry 7%              8%              7%          Housewares and appliances 6%             5%              6%             We sponsor two major hardware conventions each year at various locations. We invite dealers and vendors to attend, and  dealers generally place orders that are delivered before the next convention. During the convention, there are exhibits of  regular merchandise, new merchandise and seasonal merchandise. Lawn and garden supplies and exterior paints are seasonal  merchandise in many parts of the country. Some types of goods such as holiday decorations are also seasonal.             Warehouse sales involve the sale of merchandise that we inventory at our warehouses. Direct shipment sales involve sales  where the merchandise is shipped directly to dealers by vendors. Bulletin sales involve our special bulletin offers where we  order specific merchandise after dealers sign up to buy particular quantities of it.             Dealers place direct shipment orders with our vendors using special purchase orders. The vendors then bill us for these  orders, which are shipped directly to dealers. We, in turn, bill the ordering dealers with an adder ("handling charge") that  varies according to the following schedule:                _Invoice Amount_       _Adder (Handling Charge)_            $  1,00.00    to    $  999.99 2.00%          $1,000.00   to    $1,999.99 1.75%          $2,000.00   to    $ 2,999.99 1.50%          $3,000.00   to    $ 3,999.99 1.25%          $4,000.00   to    $ 4,999.99 1.00%          $5,000.00   to    $ 5,999.99 ..75%          $6,000.00   to    $ 6,999.99 ..50%          $7,000.00   to    $ 7,999.99 ..25%          $8,000.00 and over .00%             We make bulletin sales based upon notices from dealers that they wish to participate in one of our special bulletin offers.  Generally, we notify dealers of our intention to purchase certain products for bulletin shipment. We then purchase these  products in the quantities that the dealers order. When the bulletin shipment arrives, we do not place it into warehouse  inventory. Rather, we break it up into smaller quantities and deliver it to the dealers who ordered it. We generally apply a 6%  adder ("handling charge") to this category of sales.             We typically apply an additional adder of 3% to merchandise that is exported outside of the United States, its territories  and possessions. Ace dealers located outside of the United States, its territories and possessions who are not subject to the  additional 3% adder are assessed a flat 2% adder on all direct shipment sales. We maintain inventories to meet only normal  resupply orders. Resupply orders help keep our inventories at normal levels. Usually these resupply orders are filled within  one day of receipt. Bulletin orders are somewhat similar to resupply orders, but can be for future delivery. We do not backlog  normal resupply orders and therefore, no significant backlog exists at any point in time.             Our Store Traffic Opportunity Program ("STOP") is a program where we offer our dealers specific products that we  assign to a "competitive price sales" classification. These products are delivered from our warehouses with or without the  addition of freight charges and with an adder (if any) of up to 5%, determined on an item by item basis. Management has the  authority to add and withdraw items from the STOP program, and to establish reasonable minimum or multiple item purchase  requirements for this program. We do not make any patronage dividend distributions for purchases under the STOP program.  We do, however, consider STOP purchases to be either warehouse purchases or bulletin purchases, as applicable, in  determining the forms of patronage dividend distributions. (See the heading "Business," subheading "Forms of Patronage  Dividend Distributions.")             Our LTL Plus Program allows dealers to purchase full or partial truckloads of products from specific vendors for direct  shipment delivery. No adder or national advertising assessment applies to these purchases. (See heading "Business,"  subheading "Patronage Dividend Determinations and Allocations.")             In addition to hosting conventions as well as other shows and product exhibits for our dealers, we also provide many  special services. We offer these services at established charges. These services include inventory control systems, as well as  price and bin ticketing. We also provide dealers with a checklist service so that they can have current information about the  merchandise that we offer. We also provide a choice of ongoing educational and training programs for dealers. (See the  heading "Business," subheading "Special Charges and Assessments.")             Our wholly owned subsidiary, Ace Insurance Agency, Inc., offers a Group Dealer Insurance Program so that dealers can  purchase different types of insurance coverage. This program offers "all risk" property insurance and business interruption,  crime, liability and workers' compensation insurance, in addition to medical insurance for store employees. Loss Prevention  Services, Inc., another wholly owned subsidiary, offers security training and other loss prevention services to dealers.             On February 13, 2003, we sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of Ace Hardware Canada Limited ("Ace  Canada"), our wholly owned subsidiary, to Sodisco-Howden Group Inc. Ace Canada generated less than one percent (1%) of  our consolidated revenues during fiscal year 2002.             We operate our Company-owned retail hardware stores through our wholly owned subsidiary Ace Corporate Stores, Inc.  For further information about these stores, please see the heading "Properties."             We manufacture paint and similar coating products at our factories in Matteson and Chicago Heights, Illinois. These  factories are the main source of the paint products that we offer for sale. We operate our paint manufacturing business as a  separate division of our Company for accounting purposes. We purchase all our raw materials for paint manufacturing from  outside sources. We have had adequate sources of raw materials in the past, and we do not currently expect any shortages of  raw materials that would have a major impact on our paint operations. Paint manufacturing is seasonal in the sense that  greater paint sales occur from April through September. Historically, our need to comply with environmental laws and  regulations has not had a major effect on our ability to conduct our paint manufacturing operations.             Our businesses, hardware wholesaling and paint manufacturing, are not dependent on any major suppliers and we feel  that seasonal fluctuations do not have a major effect on our operations. For more discussion of our business, see  "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."             We also offer services to members that relate to the operation of their retail businesses. We provide these services (such  as advertising, merchandising and training programs) to assist our members and in some cases, to maximize our centralized  buying power.        Strategic Planning                We have a strategic planning process that results in goals, objectives and programs that we want to develop in the future  for Ace and our members. Because strategic plans deal with the future, this discussion of them contains "forward looking  statements," which are based on our current expectations. The actual results of our efforts can differ greatly from the results  that we might desire. We believe that we have the facilities, the employees and the resources for ongoing success as we  implement our plans and programs. However, the future is difficult to forecast, especially related to revenues, costs, margins  and profits which are influenced by many factors. Some of these factors are discussed below.             The effects of future growth in the hardware and hardlines-related industries are uncertain. By "hardlines-related  industries" we mean home center, do-it-yourself, rental and commercial/industrial categories. The future condition of the  economy is also uncertain, when viewed domestically, internationally or in specific geographical regions. Some other  uncertainties that could affect our plans include possible future changes in merchandise and inventory prices, and the effect of  increasingly intense competition. There could be potential shifts in market demand for some products. Lawsuits and laws,  especially laws dealing with franchising, licensing, importing, exporting and environmental matters could affect our future  business. We cannot predict whether these uncertainties might give rise to future costs or liabilities or have some other effect  on our future ability to achieve our plans.             Through our ongoing strategic planning process we have focused our plans around four segments for future growth and  success in our competitive industry. These four segments are: Retail Success (store operations), Wholesale Success  (distribution), International growth and new member growth. Retail success for our dealers is a primary objective because, in  our opinion, it drives both their retail performance and our wholesale growth. We have therefore increased our efforts to assist  members in "retail success initiatives," which are designed to improve their retail performance and competitiveness. These  retail success initiatives include retail goals that we urge dealers to strive for within their stores and in locally competitive  markets. These goals do not, however, impose major restrictions or requirements on members. Our minimum requirements for  the acceptance of new members are outlined in the current Membership Agreement and Supplement and in the Member  Operational Requirements that apply under that Agreement. The Operational Requirements do require that, within one year,  the member must make us the primary source of supply and terminate any previous participation in the program of any other  major hardware wholesaler. There are currently no general requirements (apart from special voluntary programs) where  members have to make particular percentages of purchases from us or have to achieve minimum retail performance levels,  such as sales dollars per square foot.             Our current strategic initiative, Vision 21, focuses on becoming a world class organization through encouraging dealers  to adopt certain merchandising,  marketing and operational practices that are supported by some of our most successful dealers  to improve Ace's and the dealers' overall competitiveness and efficiency. The cornerstones to Vision 21 are to improve  retailer's sales and profits, streamline our processes, bring wholesale and retail together as one Ace team and provide ultimate  customer satisfaction. Vision 21 goals include minimizing disparities between retail and wholesale, developing dealer-friendly  procedures that take duplication and costs out of dealers' operations, achieving consistent implementation of programs more  rapidly and improving the dealers' financial performance and their ability to pursue new stores and store expansions. As  retailers become Vision 21 retailers they are afforded various benefits to assist them to succeed at retail.        Special Charges and Assessments                We sponsor a national advertising program. To pay for this program, we assess dealers an amount equal to 1.50% of their  purchases (except purchases of LTL Plus products, building material products and certain hardware and software computer  systems), with minimum yearly assessments of $2,223.00 (effective January 1, 2003, $2,535.00 or 1.50% of the annual  purchase volume of required purchases in order for a store to avoid imposition of the low volume account service charge, if  greater). The maximum yearly assessment is $6,800.00 (based on purchases) for each store location. We grant exemptions  from these assessments and make various adjustments to them for stores located outside the continental United States, for new  stores during their start up year and for stores operating under an agreement that does not permit them to use "Ace" or "Ace  Hardware". We intend to also impose a flat charge of $100.00 on a per event basis to pay for national sales promotions  including, but not limited to, the Memorial Day sale and the day after Thanksgiving sale. The amount of our national  advertising assessment can be changed from time to time by our Board of Directors. We can also impose assessments at a flat  monthly rate or based on a percentage of sales for regional advertising not to exceed 2% of a dealer's annual purchases.  Regional advertising assessments are subject to the same minimum and maximum amounts as the national advertising  assessment.             Through December 31, 2002, every two weeks, we billed the member store for a special low volume account service  charge of $75 if annual purchases from us were less than $50,000. We billed the member store for a special low volume  account service charge of $60 per bi-weekly billing statement period if purchases from us during such period were less than  $5,700. Effective January 1, 2003, we will bill the member store for a special low volume account service charge of $100 per  bi-weekly billing statement period if purchases from us during such period are less than $6,500. The low volume service  charges that we bill to the store in a specific year are automatically refunded if that store's total purchases increase to over  $169,000 during the year. A new store is excused from this low volume account service charge during the first 12 months that  it is a member. There are some exceptions to our low volume account service charges that are described below:             1.    Stores which purchase $169,000 of merchandise from us during the year are given a credit on the next billing  statement for any low volume charges which we billed that store earlier in the year. We then stop billing that store for low  volume account service charges for the rest of the year, even if its current purchases on a billing statement are less than  $6,500.          2.    We do not bill low volume account service charges every two weeks if a store's sales volume with us the year before  was at our minimum ($169,000), but we will bill these charges in a lump sum to a store's last statement of the year if that  store does not reach our applicable minimum by that time.          3.    We will not bill low volume account service charges to members that have signed and are in compliance with a  Vision 21 Retailer and Retail Support Commitment ("Vision 21 Agreement"), but we will bill low volume account service  charges, if applicable, to members who are not in compliance with their Vision 21 Agreements.             Low volume service charges are not included in a retailer's purchases of merchandise that qualify for patronage  dividends. An Ace store that falls below our minimum purchase levels can also be subject to termination.             We add a late payment service charge on any past due balance that we are owed for merchandise, services, or for a stock  subscription. The current rate for the late payment service charge is .77% per bi-weekly statement period, except in Texas  where the charge is .384% and Georgia where the charge is .692%. We consider a past due balance to exist whenever we do  not receive payment of the amount shown as due on a billing statement within 10 days after the date of that statement. We can  change the rate of our late payment service charge from time to time.             We assess members operating under a standard Membership Agreement a mandatory monthly fee for Core Retail  Services in the amount of $168 per month for all single stores or parent stores and $37 per month for all branch stores located  in the United States. Core Retail Services consist of the following elements:             1.    ACENET. This service is our primary communications vehicle with our members. It is an electronic network that  allows defective goods claims processing, product search online or through a CD-ROM catalog, electronic communications,  employee testing and training courses, review and payment of retailer statements and numerous other applications.             2.    Material Safety Data Sheet Subscription Service. This service provides members with access 24 hours per day and 7  days per week to information on the chemical ingredients of certain products that we sell.             3.    Ace Training Network. This service is one of our retail training programs. Each single store or parent store is  credited with 16 points per month and each branch store is credited with 11 points per month. A single store or parent store is  one that has purchased or subscribed for a share of our Class A voting stock. A branch store is one whose membership  involves only shares (or a subscription for shares) of our nonvoting Class C Stock. (See Article XXV, Section 2 of our By-  laws). A store may use its points at any time to buy one of the training programs that we offer. If a store does not have enough  points for the program that it wants, it can use the points that it has and be billed for the difference. Multiple stores and  member groups can pool their points together to purchase our training programs.             4.    NRHA E-Tools. These include unlimited use of certain Internet- based services offered by the National Retail  Hardware Association (NRHA), including their Advanced Course in Hardware Retailing, the Forte International  Communications Survey and their Employee Compensation Study.             5.    Retail Pricing. This includes access to our national price shopping and ad data collected from non-Ace stores, our  suggested retail prices, our customized retail pricing strategy services and catalog updates to our suggested retail prices.             Members operating under a Contractor agreement are assessed a mandatory monthly fee of $53 for ACENET and the  Material Safety Data Sheet Subscription Service; however, there are no members operating under a Contractor agreement as  of the date of this annual report.        Trademark and Service Mark Registrations                The names "ACE HARDWARE" and "ACE" are used extensively by members and ourselves in the promotion,  advertising and marketing of products and services that we sell. We have had the following trademark and service mark  registrations issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our marks:                                            Registration

hardware industry are intense and increasing. Independent hardware  retailers must remain competitive with discount stores and chain stores, such as WalMart, Home Depot, Menard's, Sears, and  Lowe's, and with other mass merchandisers. Retail hardware stores have been slowly shifting their locations to high rent  shopping centers. There has also been a trend toward longer store hours. There is intense pressure on hardware retailers to  obtain low cost wholesale supply sources. In several markets in the United States, we also compete directly with other dealer-  owned wholesalers such as TruServ Corporation, Do it Best Corporation and United Hardware Distributing Co.        Employees                As of December 28, 2002, we have 5,268 full-time employees, of which 1,555 are salaried employees. Excluding our  Canadian operations and Company-owned retail locations, we have 4,824 full- time employees to support our domestic and  international retailers. We also have, as of the end of the 2002 fiscal year, union contracts covering one (1) truck drivers'  bargaining unit and two (2) warehouse bargaining units. We consider our employee relations with both union and non-union  employees to be good, and we have had no strikes in the past five years. In general, our employees are covered by either  negotiated or nonnegotiated benefit plans that include hospitalization, death benefits and, with few exceptions, retirement  benefits.        Limitations on Ownership of Stock                Our members own all of our outstanding shares of capital stock. Membership in Ace is limited to approved dealers in  hardware and related products who have Membership Agreements with us. These are the only ones eligible to own or  purchase shares of any class of our stock.             No dealer is allowed to own more than 1 share of our Class A voting stock, no matter how many store locations that  dealer owns or controls. This ensures that each stockholder in our cooperative has equal voting power. We treat an  unincorporated member or a partnership member as being controlled by someone else if 50% or more of the assets or profit  shares of that member are owned by (i) another person, partnership or corporation; or (ii) the owner(s) of 50% or more of the  assets or profit shares of another unincorporated business firm or (iii) the owner(s) of at least 50% of the capital stock of a  corporation. We treat a member that is a corporation as being controlled by someone else if at least 50% of the capital stock  of that member is owned by (i) another person, partnership or corporation; or (ii) the owner(s) of at least 50% of the capital  stock of another corporation; or (iii) the owner(s) of at least 50% of the assets or profit shares of another unincorporated  business.        Distribution of Patronage Dividends                We operate on a cooperative basis for patronage purchases of merchandise from us that are made by dealers who have  become members of Ace. We also operate on a cooperative basis with dealers who have subscribed for shares of our stock but  who have not yet actually become "members" because they have not yet fully paid for their $1,000 par value shares of our  Class A voting stock. The dealers in either of these two categories are entitled to receive patronage dividends once a year on  an equitable basis.             We made patronage dividend distributions at the following percentages of our sales in the warehouse, bulletin and direct  shipment categories and on the total sales of products manufactured by our Paint Division during the past three fiscal years:                                                         _2002_              _2001_     _2000_                    Warehouse Sales 4.56348%     4.27330%       4.43564%                  Bulletin Sales 2.0%             2.0%               2.0%                  Direct Shipment Sales 1.0%            1.0%                1.0%                  Paint Sales 10.1109%      8.9371%          8.1131%             Under our LTL Plus Program, we also calculate patronage dividends separately on sales of full or partial truckloads of  products purchased by eligible dealers from certain vendors (see discussion of LTL Plus Program under the heading  "Business.") The LTL Plus Program patronage dividend was 0.5% of these sales for fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000.             Sales of merchandise under our Contractor and Industrial Distributor Programs are made on a nonpatronage basis.        Patronage Dividend Determinations and Allocations                The amounts that we distribute as patronage dividends consist of our gross profits on patronage business that we do with  dealers who qualify for patronage dividend distributions, less a proportionate share of our expenses for administration and  operations. Our gross profits consist of the difference between our selling price for the merchandise that these dealers buy  from us and our purchase price for that merchandise. The total patronage dividend paid to members is based on net earnings  calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America after reducing or  increasing net earnings for non-member income or losses. Our computation of patronage dividends excludes all of our income  and expenses from activities that are not directly related to patronage transactions. The excluded items primarily consist of  profits or losses generated from non-shareholder international dealers and non-shareholder retail accounts served through  National Hardlines Supply, Inc. and our industrial distributor and contractor programs, profits or losses realized from Ace  Insurance Agency, Inc., New Age Insurance Limited, Ace Hardware Canada Limited, company-owned retail locations and our  share of the profits or losses realized from our minority-owned investments including Builder Marts of America, Inc. and joint  ventures. Additionally, any income or loss that we realize from the disposition of property and equipment is excluded from  patronage dividends. The amount we distribute as patronage dividends also excludes profits or losses generated from our non-  shareholder programs. (See the heading "Business" and the subheading "Non- Shareholders Programs".)             Patronage dividends are usually paid to members within 90 days after the close of Ace's fiscal year; however, the Internal  Revenue Code (the "Code") permits distribution of patronage dividends as late as the 15th day of the ninth month after the  close of Ace's fiscal year, and Ace may elect to distribute the annual patronage dividend at a later time than usual in  accordance with the provisions of the Code.             Our By-laws provide that, by virtue of dealers being "members" of Ace (that is, by owning shares of our Class A voting  stock), they consent to include in their gross income for federal income tax purposes all patronage dividends that we distribute  to them. These distributions must be included in gross income for the taxable year in which the dealer receives them. Dealers  who have not yet fully paid the $1,000 purchase price for their shares of our Class A voting stock are also required to include  all patronage dividends we distribute to them in their gross income as explained above. Under our Stock Subscription  Agreement, dealers must expressly consent to take these patronage dividend distributions into their gross incomes.             The amount of the patronage dividends which dealers must include in their gross incomes includes both the cash portion  of patronage dividends and any portion of patronage dividends that we apply against any indebtedness the dealer owes to us in  accordance with Section 7 of Article XXIV of our By-laws. It also includes any portion of patronage dividends that they  receive in shares of our Class C nonvoting stock, other property and patronage refund certificates. Ace also has the authority  to issue a portion of the patronage dividend in the form of other property.             Under our present program, patronage dividends on each of our three basic categories of sales (warehouse sales, bulletin  sales and direct shipment sales) are allocated separately, as are patronage dividends under our LTL Plus Program. Dividend  percentage calculations are made with reference to the net earnings derived from each of the respective categories. The 2002  patronage dividend rate for the LTL Plus Program is 0.5% of our LTL Plus sales. The 2002 patronage dividend rates for direct  shipment and bulletin sales are 1.0% and 2.0%, respectively, while the current 2002 warehouse patronage dividend rate is  4.56%.             Patronage dividends are calculated separately for full and partial truckloads of products purchased under the LTL Plus  Program. (See the heading "Business", discussion of LTL Plus Program and the subheading "Forms of Patronage Dividend  Distributions" below.)             Any manufacturing profit realized on intracompany sales of products manufactured by our Paint Division is allocated and  distributed as patronage dividends to eligible dealers in proportion to their respective annual dollar purchases of paint and  related products from that division. The earnings we realize on wholesale sales of the Paint Division's products to our eligible  dealers are currently distributed as patronage dividends to them as part of the patronage dividends which they receive each  year in the basic patronage dividend categories of warehouse sales, bulletin sales and direct shipment sales. The 2002 paint  patronage dividend rate is 10.11%. Under Section 8 of Article XXIV of our By- laws, if the Paint Division's  manufacturing  operations for any year result in a net loss instead of a profit to the Paint Division, this loss would be netted against the  earnings we realized from our other activities during the year, so that the earnings available for distribution as patronage  dividends from these other activities would be reduced for the year. Therefore, if a loss were to result from Paint Division  activities, it would result in a reduced patronage dividend to all members, irrespective of their paint purchases.             We have established a LBM Retailer Incentive Pool Plan for our members who purchase LBM products through Builder  Marts of America, Inc. ("BMA") and are eligible participants under our Contractor Center standards. This is not a patronage  dividend plan, but rather an allocation of the increase in our stock investment in BMA. Under the plan, we calculate an annual  estimate of the amount by which our stock in BMA has increased or decreased in value from our initial investment, net of  certain expenses. We allocate this estimate to eligible members annually based on their qualifying purchases of LBM products.  A member's pool allocation only becomes vested and can only be redeemed upon the termination of the member's Ace  membership which results in the sale or redemption of Ace stock held for that location, Ace's termination of the LBM  Retailer Incentive Pool Plan, or Ace's liquidation, whichever occurs first. Negative pool balances are not charged to  members. The 2002 incentive pool rate under this plan is 0.57% of qualifying purchases.        Forms of Patronage Dividend Distributions                We make patronage dividend distributions to our eligible dealers in cash, shares of our Class C Stock and patronage  refund certificates according to a specific plan that has been adopted by our Board of Directors. This plan can be changed  from time to time by the Board as they deem fit depending on business conditions and Ace's needs.             This plan is summarized below for the purchases that our eligible dealers make from us for the year 2000 and subsequent  years.             1.    For each of a dealer's eligible stores, we initially calculate the minimum cash patronage dividend distribution as  follows:                  (a)    20% of the first $5,000 of the total patronage dividends allocated for distribution each year to the dealer based                          on the purchases made for the eligible store;                  (b)    25% of the portion of the total patronage dividends allocated for that store which exceed $5,000 but do not                          exceed $7,500;                  (c)    30% of the portion of the total patronage dividends allocated for that store which exceed $7,500 but do not                          exceed $10,000;                  (d)    35% of the portion of the total patronage dividends allocated for that store which exceed $10,000 but do not                          exceed $12,500;                  (e)    40% of the portion of the total patronage dividends allocated for that store which exceed $12,500.             2.    We distribute the portion of patronage dividends in excess of the cash or property amounts above in the form of  shares of our Class C nonvoting stock (par value $100 per share) until the total par value of all shares of all classes of our  capital stock that a dealer holds for the eligible store equals the greater of:                  (a)    $20,000; or                  (b)    the sum of purchases in the following categories that a dealer made for the eligible store during the most recent                            calendar year:                              (i)    15% of the volume of Ace manufactured paint and related products purchases, plus                              (ii)   3% of the volume of drop-shipment or direct purchases (excluding Ace manufactured paint and related                                      products), plus                              (iii)  15% of the volume of warehouse and bulletin purchases (including Stop and excluding Ace manufactured                                      paint and related products), plus                              (iv)  4% of the volume of LTL Plus purchases.             Please note, however, that we do not issue fractional shares of Class C Stock. We take any amount that would result  in a fractional share of stock and distribute it in cash or patronage refund certificates instead.             3.    The portion of a dealer's total patronage dividends for each of the dealer's eligible stores which exceeds the sum of:                  (a)    the cash amount determined under Paragraph 1 above and                  (b)    the amount of Class C Stock determined under Paragraph 2 above is distributed to the dealer in cash up to                           certain limits. The total amount that a dealer receives in cash for an eligible store cannot exceed 45% of that                           store's total patronage dividends for the year. If a store's total cash distribution would exceed this 45% limit,                           then the distribution over that amount is made instead in the form of a non-negotiable patronage refund                           certificate. Our Board of Directors determines the maturity dates and interest rates of these patronage refund                           certificates before they are issued. These certificates include provisions that give us a first lien on the amount of                           any indebtedness that a dealer owes us. The certificates also contain language subordinating them to all the                           rights and claims of our secured creditors, general creditors and our bank creditors. Historically, these patronage                           refund certificates have matured within five years from the date we issued them.             Article XXIV, Section 7 of our By-laws requires the cash portion of any patronage dividends to be applied against any  indebtedness a member owes us where the membership for his store is terminated before the distribution of patronage  dividends. Despite this, however, 20% of a terminated store's total annual patronage dividends will be paid in cash if we  receive a timely request for this form of payment.             Because of the requirement of the U. S. Internal Revenue Code that we withhold 30% of the annual patronage dividends  distributed to eligible dealers whose places of business are located in foreign countries or Puerto Rico, the cash portion of  patronage dividends to these dealers is a minimum of 30%. There are exceptions to this 30% cash payment in the case of 1)  unincorporated Puerto Rico dealers owned by individuals who are U.S. citizens, 2) certain dealers incorporated in Guam,  American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands or the U.S. Virgin Islands. These exceptions apply if less than 25% of the  stock of these dealers is owned by foreign persons, and at least 65% of their gross income for the last three years has been  sufficiently connected with a trade or business in one of these locations or in the United States and 3) dealers located in  countries maintaining tax treaties with the United States that provide for reduced rates of withholding.             We also have certain loan programs that allow dealers to pay us back with part of their patronage dividend distributions.  For example, to help members buy standardized exterior signs identifying their stores, our Board of Directors has authorized a  loan program. Under this program, a dealer may apply to borrow between $100 to $25,000 per location from us for this  purpose. If a dealer obtains a loan under this program, the dealer may either repay it in twelve payments billed on the regular  bi-weekly billing statement, or the dealer may apply the non-cash portion of the annual patronage dividends (for up to the next  three annual patronage dividend distributions) toward payment of the loan.             Our Board of Directors has also authorized a loan program to help qualified dealers pay for costs of converting their  stores from another hardware distributor's program to our program. Under this loan program, these dealers can borrow up to  $95,000 per store. If the dealer obtains a loan under this program, we will apply the non-cash portion of the dealer's annual  patronage dividends (for up to the next three annual patronage dividend distributions) towards payment of the loan. Unless  extended by the Board of Directors, this loan program will remain in effect until June 1, 2003 or until 100 loans are made,  whichever occurs first.             Our Board of Directors has also authorized finance programs to help qualified dealers buy certain computer systems from  us with patronage dividends. The amount financed cannot exceed 80% of the cost of any system. For PAINTMAKER  computers, members have applied to borrow between $4,000 to $25,000 per location repayable over a period of three (3)  years.             Under these programs, members have directed us to first apply the patronage refund certificate portion of their patronage  dividend distributions toward the balance owed on financed items and next to apply patronage dividends which would  otherwise be payable for the same year in the form of our Class C Stock. These signage, computer financing and store  conversion programs may be revised or discontinued by our Board at any time.             Members also have the ability to apply for a Capital Stock loan which is designed to provide them with access to their  future patronage dividends to assist them in opening new retail stores or to assist in significant store expansions. These loans  are repaid at the end of seven (7) years from patronage distributions of the non-cash portion of the annual patronage rebate on  the respective store during that period.        Federal Income Tax Treatment of Patronage Dividends                Both the shares of Class C nonvoting stock and the patronage refund certificates that we use to pay patronage dividends  are "qualified written notices of allocation" within the meaning of Sections 1381 through 1388 of the U.S. Internal Revenue  Code. Ace may pay a portion of its dividend in the form of other qualified property pursuant to Section 1382 of the U.S.  Internal Revenue Code. These Sections of the Internal Revenue Code deal with the income tax treatment of cooperatives and  their patrons and have been in effect since 1963. The dollar amount stated on a qualified written notice of allocation and fair  market value of other qualified property must be taken into the gross income of the person to whom the notice is issued, even  though this dollar amount may not actually be paid to the person in the same year that it is taxed.             In order for us to receive a deduction from our gross income for federal income tax purposes for the amount of any  patronage dividends that we pay to a patron (that is, to one of our eligible and qualifying dealers) in the form of qualified  written notices of allocation or other qualified property, we have to pay (or apply against any indebtedness that the patron  owes us in accordance with Section 7 of Article XXIV of our By-laws) not less than 20% of each patron's total patronage  dividend distribution in cash and the patron also has to consent to having the written notices of allocation at their stated dollar  amounts, and other qualified property at the fair market value, included in his gross income for the taxable year in which he  receives them. The Internal Revenue Code also requires that any patronage dividend distributions that we deduct on our  federal income tax return for business we do with patrons must be paid to those patrons within eight and one-half months after  the end of that taxable year.             By becoming one of our "members" by owning 1 share of Class A voting stock, a patron is deemed under the U.S.  Internal Revenue Code to have consented to take the written notices of allocation and other qualified property that we  distribute into the patron's gross income. Such consent is deemed because of 1) the act of obtaining or retaining membership  in Ace, and 2) because our By-laws provide that the membership constitutes this consent, and we give written notification of  that By-law provision. Under another provision of the Internal Revenue Code, dealers who have subscribed for shares of our  stock are also deemed to have consented to take the dollar amounts of their written notices of allocation and other qualified  property into their gross incomes. This occurs because of the consent provisions included in the Subscription Agreement for  our stock.             If a patron receives a patronage refund certificate as part of a patron's patronage dividends (see the subheading "Forms of  Patronage Dividend Distributions"), the patron may be deemed to have received interest income. This interest would arise in  the form of an original issue discount to the extent that the face amount of the certificate exceeds the present value of the  stated principal and interest payments that we have to pay the patron under the terms of the certificate. This interest income  would be taxable to a patron's "ratably" over the term of the certificate under Section 7872(b) (2) of the U.S. Internal  Revenue Code. Present value for this purpose is determined by using a discount rate equal to the applicable Federal rate in  effect as of the day of issuance of the certificate, compounded twice a year.             We are required to backup withhold for federal income tax on the total patronage dividend distribution we make to  anyone who has not furnished us with a correct taxpayer identification number. We can also be required to backup withhold  federal taxes on the cash portion of each patronage dividend distribution made to someone who fails to certify to us that he is  not subject to backup withholding. This backup withholding obligation based on a failure to certify may not be applicable,  however, unless 50% or more of the total distribution is made in cash. Since we distribute all of our patronage dividends for a  given year at the same time and since our current patronage dividend plan (see the heading "Business  " , subheading "Forms of  Patronage Dividend Distributions") does not permit any member store to receive more than 45% of its patronage dividends  for the year in cash, we believe that a certification failure like this should not ordinarily have any effect on Ace or any of its  dealers.             Patronage dividends that we distribute to patrons who are located in foreign countries or certain  U.S. possessions (including those who are incorporated in Puerto Rico or who reside in Puerto Rico but have not become  citizens of the United States) have been held to be "fixed or determinable annual or periodic income." Patrons who receive  this type of income are currently required to pay a tax of 30% of the amount received under Sections 871(a)(1)(A) and  881(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. When dealers are subject to this 30% tax, we must withhold it from their patronage  dividends and pay it over to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The above does not apply to a corporation organized in  Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands or the U. S. Virgin Islands if less than 25% of its stock is owned by  foreign persons and at least 65% of its gross income for the last three years has been effectively connected with the conduct of  a trade or business in that location or in the United States. A reduced rate of withholding may apply to dealers located in  countries maintaining tax treaties with the United States.             The 20% minimum portion of the patronage dividends that must be paid in cash to patrons other than those discussed  above may not be enough, depending upon the patron's income tax bracket, to pay all of the patron's federal income tax on  his annual patronage dividend distributions. In our management's opinion, the payment of a minimum of 20% of total  patronage dividends in cash each year will not have a material adverse affect on our operations or on our ability to obtain  sufficient working capital for the normal requirements of our business.        Membership Agreements                Persons who apply to become an Ace member must sign a Subscription Agreement to purchase our stock. They must also  sign our customary Membership Agreement and Supplement and submit a payment of $1,500 ($2,500 for conversions or new  investor ground-ups) with their signed Membership Agreement and Supplement. We use this fee toward our estimated costs  of processing the membership applications. A membership may generally be terminated upon various notice periods and for  various reasons (including voluntary termination by either party). The details of these reasons and notice periods are  contained in the Membership Agreement. These reasons for termination and notice periods apply except where special laws or  regulations in certain locations limit our right to terminate  memberships, or require longer notice periods.        Non-Shareholder Programs                In 1989, our Board of Directors first authorized us to affiliate non- shareholder international dealers who operate retail  businesses outside the United States, its territories and possessions. These international dealers sign agreements that differ  from our regular Membership Agreement. They may be granted a license to use certain of our trademarks and service marks,  but they do not sign stock subscription agreements or become shareholders, nor do they receive patronage dividends.             In 1995, our Board of Directors first authorized us to affiliate non- shareholder retail accounts other than international  dealers. These accounts, which are generally served through our wholly-owned subsidiary National Hardlines Supply, Inc.  ("NHS"), are not granted an ongoing license to use our trademarks and service marks. They can purchase selected types of  products from us for resale. They are not members of our cooperative, and therefore do not own our stock or receive  patronage dividends.             In 1996, we established a license program for international non- shareholder dealers. These international licensees  typically receive the exclusive right to use our trademarks and service marks, as well as exclusive rights to distribute the  merchandise they purchase from us in their home countries. International licensees pay us a negotiated license fee and  ongoing royalties on their retail sales in exchange for these rights, and for our ongoing training and support.             In 1998, the Company began developing joint ventures with certain dealers as a way of increasing the Ace presence in  key markets without the need for Ace to use solely its own resources to open company stores. For each joint venture, the  Company and the member enter into a Limited Liability Company Agreement, with the retailer acting as the managing  member, and form a limited liability company ("LLC") to operate the joint venture stores. In each joint venture, we own 50%  or less of the LLC's units. Currently, Ace has an ownership interest in seven joint ventures. In the future, we may explore  other joint venture opportunities with our members; however, we consider each situation unique and we evaluate each  opportunity on its own merits.             In our sole discretion, we may offer a member a mutually agreeable termination arrangement. In some situations, a  member who terminates on this basis may be offered the opportunity to purchase products from us (including Ace private  label products) for a period of up to 5 years after the termination of membership. The former member is not required to make  any such purchases from us, but must maintain favorable credit status in order to do so.             In 1999, we entered into an agreement with Builder Marts of America (BMA), to combine our lumber and building  materials division (the "LBM division") with BMA, a non-cooperative buying group for lumber and building materials in the  United States. Under this agreement, we contributed certain business assets (primarily vendor rebate receivables, fixed assets  and inventories) in exchange for a non-controlling (28%) interest in the combined entity. The investment in the combined  entity is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As a result of this transaction, we have established an LBM  Retailer Incentive Pool Plan for our members who purchase LBM products through BMA. This program is not a patronage  dividend plan but rather a process for allocating the increase in the value of our investment in BMA to those qualifying  dealers who purchase LBM products through BMA. (See the heading "Business", subheading "Patronage Dividend  Determinations and Allocations".)             In 2001, we developed a non-shareholder industrial distributor program. These industrial distributors can purchase  selected types of products from us for resale under an Industrial Distributor Agreement or Distributor Franchise Agreement.  They are not members of our cooperative by reason of their participation in the industrial distributor program, and therefore  do not own stock or receive patronage dividends in connection with that program. These programs are made available to  cooperative members, however, members will not receive patronage dividends for purchases of products under these  programs.             Sales to international non-shareholder dealers accounted for approximately 1.9 % of our merchandise sales in 2002,  approximately 2.0% of our merchandise sales in 2001 and approximately 2.2% of our merchandise sales in 2000. Sales to  domestic non-shareholder locations accounted for less than 1.0 % of our total sales in 2002, less than 2.0% of our total sales in  2001 and less than 3.0% of our total sales in 2000. (See Appendix A, Article XXV, section 2 of our By-laws regarding  International Retail Merchants and non-member accounts.)             In connection with the sales of the shares of Ace Canada to Sodisco- Howden Group Inc. on February 13, 2003, we  signed a License Agreement granting Ace Canada the right to operate, and license others to operate, retail hardware stores  under our trademarks and service marks. These retail hardware dealers are not shareholders and do not receive patronage  dividends from us.        Item 2.

Ace intends to exercise an option to purchase this property by            September, 2003, and to develop this property for use as a distribution warehouse.      (4) This property is leased for use as a freight consolidation center.      (5) Our subsidiary, 3070070 Nova Scotia Company, leases this property for a distribution warehouse.             In addition to the above, we or our subsidiary, Ace Corporate Stores, Inc., lease 26 retail hardware stores ranging from  7,000 to 25,000 square feet in size located in the following states: Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon,  Washington and Wisconsin.             We also lease a fleet of trucks and equipment for the main purpose of delivering merchandise from our warehouses to our  dealers.        Item 3. Legal Proceedings                In the normal course of our business, we are a party to various legal proceedings. We do not expect that any currently  pending proceedings will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of  operations or financial condition.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                                                                              Management's Discussion and Analysis of                                                               Financial Condition and Results of Operations          Operations 2002 Compared to 2001                Consolidated sales increased 3.6%. Domestic merchandise sales increased 3.7% while International sales were flat with  2001. During 2002, sales to our domestic members increased 5.6%. The increase in domestic sales was primarily due to  higher sales to our existing retailer base, lower retailer cancellations and sales to newly affiliated retailers. This increase was  partially offset by a decrease in sales to non-coop members.             Gross profit increased $4.9 million; however decreased as a percent of total sales from 9.65% in 2001 to 9.47% in 2002.  The increase primarily resulted from higher handling charges due to a shift in sales mix towards handled sales, lower retailer  product returns and freight costs and increased paint margin due to lower raw material costs partially offset by inventory  adjustments.             Distribution operations expenses decreased $5.0 million from 2001 and decreased as a percent of total sales from 2.03%  in 2001 to 1.79% in 2002 primarily due to improved productivity, continued cost controls, lower fixed costs as a result of the  east coast distribution center reconfiguration and additional volume from logistics operations.             Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.5 million due to increased investments in technology partially  offset by lease savings due to the purchase of the corporate office location.             Retail success and development expenses increased $613,000 from 2001 primarily due to increased advertising and  marketing expenses offset by the continuation of cost control measures put in place in 2001. These expenses consist primarily  of field personnel and related costs, marketing, advertising, and training programs for Ace retailers and expenses of company-  owned retail operations. Ace continues to make investments in retail initiatives under its Vision 21 strategy to support Ace  Retailers.             Interest expense decreased $1.5 million due to lower interest rates and lower average borrowing levels under the  revolving credit facility. The decline in interest rates is primarily the result of a declining interest rate environment and the  decline in LIBOR, the basis on which our interest rate is determined. The lower average borrowing levels primarily resulted  from an increase in earnings, improved receivable collections and a reduction of inventory levels.             Other income decreased $2.4 million primarily due to a decline in retailer past due and low volume charges and lower  interest income. Additionally, 2001 included non-recurring gains on the sale of two distribution facilities offset by a write-  down of a minority-owned investment.             Income taxes decreased $3.9 million due to the taxes incurred on the sale of two retail support centers in 2001 and  increased tax benefits from non-patronage activities in 2002.             In 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to sell Ace  Hardware Canada Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary for  cash proceeds of approximately US $3.7 million and an interest bearing note of US $4.0 million. The transaction closed on  February 13, 2003, at which time the sale proceeds were received and used to repay outstanding indebtedness. The Company  recognized a loss related to the disposal of this discontinued operation of US $5.4 million in 2002 and a loss from operations  of Ace Hardware Canada Limited of US $5.4 million in 2002 and US $11.1 million in 2001. The decrease in the loss from the  discontinued operation is primarily due to costs associated with the closure of the Calgary distribution center in 2001.        Operations 2001 Compared to 2000                Consolidated sales were flat with 2000. Domestic merchandise sales increased 0.7% primarily due to conversions of new  stores to the Ace program. Sales to our existing retailer base were flat due to the soft economy and inventory reductions at  retail. International sales decreased by 18.6% primarily due to a sale of Ace affiliated stores.             Gross profit increased $7.1 million and increased slightly as a percent of total sales from 9.40% in 2000 to 9.65% in  2001. The increase was primarily due to higher vendor rebates, paint manufacturing margin and margin from company-owned  retail locations partially offset by lower cash discounts from reduced merchandise purchases.             Distribution operations expenses increased $3.0 million over 2000 and increased as a percent of total sales from 1.93% in  2000 to 2.03% in 2001. Increased utilities and distribution expenses associated with the new Loxley, Alabama distribution  facility which was open for a full year in 2001 and the start-up of the Prince George, Virginia distribution facility drove the  higher expenses. Higher logistics income partially offset the increased expenses.             Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.1 million primarily due to decreased expenses related to non-  patronage activities and continued cost control measures.             Retail success and development costs decreased $4.8 million due to continued cost control measures. Expenses in this  category are directly related to retail support of the Ace retailer. These expenses consist primarily of field personnel and  related costs, marketing, advertising and training programs for Ace retailers and expense of company-owned retail operations.  The Company continues to make investments in retail initiatives under our Vision 21 strategy to support Ace retailers.             Interest expense increased $1.4 million due to higher average borrowing levels during the year partially offset by lower  interest rates. The decline in interest rates is primarily the result of a declining interest rate environment and the decline in  LIBOR, the basis on which our interest rate is determined. The higher borrowing levels resulted from the completion of the  Loxley, Alabama and Prince George, Virginia distribution centers, the expansion of the LaCrosse, Wisconsin facility and  increased retailer dating programs.             Other income decreased $2.2 million primarily due to an increase in the write-down of a minority-owned investment of  $1.7 million and decreased interest income due to declining interest rates offset by a $3.6 million nonrecurring gain on  pension plan termination in 2000, the gain recognized on the sale of two distribution facilities and higher income realized on  non-controlling investments in affiliates.             Income taxes increased $3.3 million primarily due to deferred taxes recorded on the sale/exchange of two distribution  centers.             The loss on discontinued operation increased $10.4 million primarily due to a decline in sales volume as a result of the  loss of a significant customer and costs incurred related to the closure of the Calgary distribution center.        Liquidity and Capital Resources                Ace's ability to generate cash adequate to meet its needs ("liquidity") results from internally generated funds, short-term  lines of credit and long-term financing.             Cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity. For the year-ended December 28, 2002,  cash provided by operations increased to $140.5 million compared to $62.2 million for 2001. The increase was primarily due  to an increase in net earnings, improved receivable collections, and a reduction of inventory.             Cash used in investing activities for the year-ended December 28, 2002 was $39.6 million compared to $55.8 million in  2001. The decrease was primarily due to decreased expenditures for the distribution network as 2001 included expenditures  for the construction of the Prince George, Virginia distribution center. Net capital expenditures of $30.2 million in 2002 were  financed out of current and accumulated internally generated funds and short- term borrowings.             Cash used in financing activities for the year-ended December 28, 2002 was $101.4 million compared to $8.1 million in  2001 due to payments of short-term borrowings and 2001 proceeds of $70.0 million obtained from the issuance of Senior  Notes.             Ace has an established, unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. Ace has unsecured lines of credit of  $185.0 million of which $136.1 million was available at December 28, 2002. Borrowings under these lines of credit bear  interest at a spread over LIBOR based upon quarterly debt to EBITDA ratios. Long-term financing is arranged as determined  necessary to meet Ace's capital or other requirements, with principal amount, timing and form dependent on prevailing debt  markets and general economic conditions.             Capital expenditures for new and improved facilities were $30.2 million, $51.4 million, and $44.6 million in 2002, 2001  and 2000, respectively. Capital expenditures for 2003 are anticipated to be approximately $63.0 million primarily for a new  distribution facility, improvements to existing facilities and technology investments.             As a cooperative, Ace distributes substantially all of its patronage sourced earnings to its members in the form of  patronage dividends, which are deductible for income tax purposes.             Ace expects that existing and new internally generated funds, along with established lines of credit and long-term  financing, will continue to be sufficient in the foreseeable future to finance its working capital requirements and patronage  dividend and capital expenditure programs.             The table below presents contractual obligations and commercial commitments by year of expiration:                                                                                                                  Less than            1-3                 4-5               After 5   _Contractual Obligations_ _Total_                  _1 Year_            _Years_             _Years_ _Years  _ (000's omitted)    Short-term borrowings                                           $48,900 $48,900         $    -            $    -               $      -  Long-term debt                                                        168,722 5,647            18,336        35,739           109,000  Patronage refund certificates                                  97,016 13,196            27,326        35,843              20,651  Operating leases                                                     _  94,772 _         _  19,522 _        _   29,422 _     _   18,385 _        _   27,443 _     Total Contractual Cash Obligations                    $409,410 $87,265        $75,084       $89,967          $157,094       =======        ======        ======     ======         =======   _     _          Total Amounts       Less than            1-3                4-5 Over 5  _Other Commercial Commitments_                                    _Committed_ _1 Year_            _ Years_            _ Years_             _ Years _  _  _   (000's omitted)    Standby letters of credit                                        $13,848 $13,848          $   -            $    -             $    -  Guarantees                                                               _ 11,018 _             _    6,905 _        _ 3,396 _           _ __ __717 _ _     - - _     Total Commercial Commitments                           $24,866 $20,753          $3,396         $ 717            $    -                                                                                          ======            ======         ======       =====         =====          Critical Accounting Policies               The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,  revenues and expenses in the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, Ace evaluates its estimates and judgments based on  historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may  differ from these estimates, and our estimates would vary under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes  these estimates and assumptions are reasonable.             Ace annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that its financial  reporting and disclosures provide accurate and comprehensive information relative to the current economic and business  environment. Ace's significant accounting policies are described in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements. The following represents those critical accounting policies which involve a relatively higher degree of judgment,  estimates, and complexity and where materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using  different assumptions.                   Valuation of Inventories                When necessary, Ace provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of inventories to the lower of cost or market,          including costs to sell or dispose of surplus or damaged/obsolete inventory, and for estimated shrinkage. Estimates for the          future demand for Ace's products are key factors used by management in assessing the net realizable value of the          inventories. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, an unanticipated decline in sales at retail          outlets or a significant decline in demand for products in selected product categories, could result in valuation          adjustments.               Allowance for Doubtful Accounts               The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management's estimate of the future amount of receivables that will not be          collected. Management records allowances for doubtful accounts based on judgements made considering a number of          factors, including historical collection statistics, current dealer credit information, the aging of receivables, the current          economic environment and the offsetting amounts due to members for stock, notes, interest and declared and unpaid          dividends. While Ace believes it has appropriately considered known or expected outcomes, its dealers' ability to pay          their obligations, including those to Ace, could be adversely affected by declining sales of hardware at retail resulting          from such factors as contraction in the economy or competitive conditions in the wholesale and retail hardware          industry including increased competition from discount stores, chain stores and other mass merchandisers.        Impact of New Accounting Standards                In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets  to Be Disposed Of." The statement retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and  measurement of the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of  long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations. It also expands the previously existing  reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is  classified as held for sale. The Company applied this statement in accounting and reporting the disposal of Ace's Canadian  operations as a discontinued operation.             In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS  No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated w  ith exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at  the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Ace is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 146 prospectively for  exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002 and does not expect the implementation of this standard to have a  material effect on the consolidated financial statements.             In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for  Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others". This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be  made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. The  Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of  the obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation are applicable to  guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's  financial statements. The Company has applied the disclosure requirements of this interpretation, which were effective for  financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002.        Inflation and Changes in Prices                Ace's business is not generally governed by contracts that establish prices substantially in advance of the receipt of goods  or services. As vendors increase their prices for merchandise supplied to Ace, Ace increases the price to its dealers in an equal  amount plus the normal handling charge on such amounts. In the past, these increases have provided adequate gross profit to  offset the impact of inflation on operating expenses.        Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk                Ace is subject to certain market risks, including foreign currency and interest rates. Ace uses a variety of practices to  manage these market risks, including, when considered appropriate, derivative financial instruments. Ace uses derivative  financial instruments only for risk management and does not use them for trading or speculative purposes. Ace is exposed to  potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign  currencies. Ace's primary exposure is to changes in exchange rates for the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar.             Interest rate risk is managed through a combination of fixed rate debt and variable rate short-term borrowings with  varying maturities. At December 28, 2002, all long-term debt was issued at fixed rates.             The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for Ace's  investments and debt obligations:  >                                                             _ 2003_     _2004_        _2005_        _2006_        _2007_        _Thereafter_     _Total_                                                                                                                             (000's omitted)     Assets:      Short-term investment-            fixed rate                                  $   -           $ 1,019 $, 251        $  630          $ 6,712            $11,735             $20,347      Fixed interest rate                              -%          5.75% 2.65%        5.73%            5.73%              6.05%                5.75%  Liabilities:      Short-term borrowings-            variable rate                             $ 48,900             - -                  -                  -                      - $48,900      Average variable interest rate        1.94%             - -                  -                  -                      - 1.94%      Long-term debt-fixed rate            $ 5,647       $ 5,454       $12,882 $17,882        $17,857          $109,000            $168,722      Average fixed interest rate              7.16%        7.18%         7.18% 7.18%         7.21%               7.24%                7.16%          Ace is exposed to credit risk on certain assets, primarily accounts receivable. Ace provides credit to customers in the  ordinary course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade  receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising Ace's customer base. Ace currently believes its  allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks.             Ace's various currency exposures often offset each other, providing a natural hedge against currency risk. Ace has  utilized foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. equity investments. Gains and losses on these foreign currency  hedges are included in the basis of the underlying hedged investment. Ace did not have any outstanding foreign exchange  forward contracts at December 28, 2002 or December 29, 2001. Settlement of foreign sales and purchases are generally  denominated in U.S. currency resulting in limited foreign currency transaction exposure.        Item 8.

A minimum of 9 directors must be dealer  directors. A maximum of two directors may be non-dealer directors. Non-dealer directors cannot exceed 25% of the total  number of directors in office at any one time. Non-dealer directors may (but do not have to) be shareholders of ours who are  in the retail hardware business. Our By-laws provide for three classes of directors who are to be elected for staggered 3-year  terms, except that one director who would not otherwise be eligible for reelection in 2001 was elected at the 2001 annual  meeting of stockholders for a two year term under Article IV, Sections 1 through 3 of our By-laws. On January 23, 2001, the  Board of Directors passed a resolution reducing the number of directors from eleven to ten effective with the 2001 Annual  Stockholders meeting on June 4, 2001.             Our By-laws also provide that no one can serve as a dealer director unless that person is an owner, executive officer,  general partner or general manager of a retail business organization that is a shareholder of ours. Regional dealer directors are  elected from geographic regions of the United States. The Board under Article IV, Section 1 of our By-laws, determines these  regions. If the Board finds that regional dealer directors represent all regions, then dealer directors at large may be elected, so  long as the maximum number of directors allowed under our By-laws is not exceeded.             A geographic breakdown of our current regions for the election of directors at our 2003 annual stockholders meeting to  be held on June 2, 2003 appears below:             Region 1 - Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania,  New Jersey;             Region 2 - Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina,  District of Columbia, Ohio;             Region 3 - Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida;             Region 4 - Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin;             Region 5 - Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota,  Utah, Wyoming;             Region 6 - Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona;             Region 7 - Hawaii, California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Alaska             Under the procedure required by our By-laws, the following directors have been selected as nominees for reelection as  dealer directors at the 2003 annual stockholders meeting:        _Nominee_                                                                                            _Age_      _Class_      _Region_        _Term_     Eric R.

Mr. Hodnik participates only in the retail sales          component of the Officer Incentive Plan. The bonus amounts awarded to participants in the Plan are determined in          accordance with achievement of individual performance based objectives and achievement of corporate goals. The          maximum short-term incentive award for each executive officer is 35% to 45% of their respective salary in 2000, 2001          and 2002. The short-term bonus award becomes payable to each participant as early as practicable at or after the end of          the fiscal year.     (2)    Includes the long-term incentive award under the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Deferral Option Plan effective in          1995. The long-term Officer incentive plan is based upon corporate performance over a three year period with emphasis          on total shareholder return through maximizing both year-end patronage dividends and upfront dividends (throughout          the year) through pricing programs and discounts. This plan maintains the commitment to long-term performance and          shareholder return in a cooperative environment. One third of the total long-term incentive award is subject to a one year          vesting provision.             Effective January 1, 1995, executive officers may elect to defer a portion (20% to 100%, in 20% increments) of the          annual award granted. Participants' compensation deferrals are credited with a specified rate of interest to provide a          means to accumulate supplemental retirement benefits. Deferred benefits are payable over a period of 5 to 20 years.          Annual elections are required for the upcoming deferral year by December of the preceding year. Total long-term          incentives for the three year period ended in 2002, to be awarded in 2003, were $465,467, $84,269, $104,189, $77,378          and $124,774 for Messrs. Hodnik, Ingevaldson, Griffith, Myer and Ms. Kahle, respectively.     (3)    Includes contributions to the Company's 401-k Savings and Retirement Plan and contributions to the Company's          Retirement Benefits Replacement Plan. All active employees are eligible to participate in the Company's 401-k Savings          and Retirement Plan after 90 days of service. Those active employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement          regarding retirement benefits, which were the subject of good faith bargaining, are not eligible if such agreement does          not include them in the plan. For the year 2002, the Company contributed a maximum of 9.9% of each participant's          eligible compensation to the 401-k Savings and Retirement Plan (8.9% profit sharing and 1% Company 401-k match).          During the year 2002, $19,800 was contributed to the Company's 401-k Savings and Retirement Plan by the Company          pursuant to the Plan for each of Messrs. Hodnik, Ingevaldson, Griffith, Myer and Ms. Kahle.             The Company has also established a Retirement Benefits Replacement Plan covering all executive officers of the          Company. This is an unfunded Plan under which the participants therein are eligible to receive retirement benefits equal          to the amounts by which the benefits they would otherwise have been entitled to receive under the Company's 401-k          Savings and Retirement Plan may be reduced by reason of the limitations on contributions and benefits imposed by any          current or future provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or other federal legislation. During the year 2002,          amounts contributed to the Company's Retirement Benefits Replacement Plan were $97,232 for Mr. Hodnik, $28,298 for          Mr. Ingevaldson, $24,632 for Mr. Griffith, $25,540 for Mr. Myer and $32,770 for Ms. Kahle.             The Company also funds the base premium for a supplemental universal life insurance policy for each officer but does          not contribute to supplemental retirement benefits through this vehicle. Participants may elect to deposit a portion (up to          one-third) of the long-term incentive award into the variable annuity insurance policy in their name or may elect to defer          this portion under the Deferral Option Plan.     (4)    As a cooperative whereby all stockholders are member dealers, the Company does not grant or issue stock awards of any          kind.             Messrs. Hodnik and Ingevaldson are employed under contracts, each commencing January 1, 2003 for respective terms  of two years, through December 31, 2004. Ms. Kahle and Mr. Myer are employed under contracts, each commencing January  1, 2002 for respective terms of two years, through December 31, 2003. Mr. Griffith is employed under a contract  commencing September 1, 2002 for a term of two years, terminating August 31, 2004. The contracts provide for annual  compensation effective January 1, 2003 of $692,000, $318,000, $347,000, $305,000 and $322,000, respectively, or such  increased amount, if any, as shall be approved by the Board of Directors. If an executive's employment is terminated without  cause, each contract provides for continuing salary payments for the balance of the current contract term, with the minimum  period for these payments being 6 months (12 months in the case of Mr. Hodnik).             The Company also maintained a Pension Plan which was established December 31, 1970. The Plan was closed to new  entrants on December 31, 1995. Pension Plan benefit accruals were frozen as of February 29, 2000. The Company terminated  the Pension Plan effective April 30, 2000. All active employees were eligible to participate in this Plan on the first January 1  that they were working for the Company. Those active employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement regarding  retirement benefits which were the subject of good faith bargaining were not eligible if such agreement did not include them  in the plan. The Plan provided benefits at retirement at or after age 65 determined under a formula which took into account  60% of a participant's average base pay (including overtime) during the 5 highest consecutive calendar years of employment  and years of service prior to age 65, and under which an offset was applied for the straight life annuity equivalent of the  vested portion of the participant in the amount of benefits provided for them by the Company under the Profit Sharing Plan.             Examples of yearly benefits provided by the Pension Plan (prior to reduction by the Profit Sharing Plan offset) were as  follows:                     _Years of Service_  _Remuneration_                                          _10_              _15_ _20_              _25_                _  30 or more    _$200,000                                                             $40,000 $60,000          $80,000         $100,000                $120,000  $170,000                                                               34,000 51,000            68,000             85,000                  102,000  $150,000                                                               30,000 45,000            60,000             75,000                    90,000  $100,000                                                               20,000 30,000            40,000             50,000                    60,000  $  50,000                                                               10,000 15,000            20,000             25,000                    30,000             The amounts shown above represent straight life annuity amounts. Maximum benefits from the Pension Plan were  attained after 30 years of service and attainment of age 65. The compensation covered by the Pension Plan consisted of base  compensation (exclusive of bonuses and non-recurring salary or wage payments) not to exceed $200,000 of such total  remuneration paid to a participant during any plan year. Remuneration and yearly benefits under the Plan were limited, and  subject to adjustment, under Sections 415(d) and 401(a)17 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The amount of covered  compensation under the Pension Plan, therefore was $200,000 for each Executive Officer named in the Compensation table.  Upon termination of the plan, the credited years of service under the Pension Plan for the currently employed executive  officers named in the compensation table were as follows: David F. Hodnik - 27 years; Paul M. Ingevaldson - 20 years; Ray  A. Griffith - 6 years; David F. Myer - 18 years and Rita D. Kahle - 14 years.        Compensation Committee Report                The Compensation Committee is responsible for approving the compensation programs, plans and guidelines for all  Corporate and Company Officers, and administering the Company's Executive Incentive Plans. Our decisions are based on  our understanding of Ace's business and its long-term strategies, as well as our knowledge of the capabilities and performance  of the Company and of the executives. We stress long-term measured results, focus on team work, accepting prudent risks  and are strongly committed to fulfilling retailer and consumer needs.             We believe that our retailers (shareholders) are best served by running the Company with a long-term perspective while  striving to deliver consistently good year-end results. Therefore, the Company's Executive Compensation Program and  Officer Incentive Plan has been designed to attract, retain and reward superior talent that will produce positive results and  enhance Ace's position in the highly competitive hardware and home improvement marketplace. The Company is led by  exceptional leaders, many of them long-term Ace team members; while others bring experiences from outside Ace.             We believe the compensation for our executives should be competitive with other high performing retail companies in  order to motivate and retain the talent needed to produce superior results. In that regard, our Committee conducts an overall  review of compensation programs and philosophies bi-annually. We review information supplied by an independent  Compensation consultant and other marketplace data to determine the competitiveness of Ace's total compensation package.             The Committee believes that special leadership competencies and sensitivities are required to balance the unique  relationship between and among the Company, its employees, retailers and vendors. Therefore, we go beyond a simple  evaluation of competitive salary information and Company financial results in making compensation decisions.             Our Committee annually establishes an executive's base salary, based on evaluation of the executive's level of  responsibility and individual performance considered in light of competitive pay practices. We gage Executive performance in  developing and executing corporate strategies; leading and developing people; initiating and leading change; passion for retail  success; balancing the many relationships within and outside the Ace family; and leading and coordinating with others,  programs which impact Company and retailer performance.             Under the Officer Incentive Plan each officer is assigned an incentive target percent at the beginning of the year (the  greater the Officer's responsibility, the higher the target percent is of base salary). This plan has individual, team and retail  sales components. This concept is used to reflect the accomplishments of each Officer's functional organization results,  overall Company wholesale performance and retail sales growth compared to the competition.             Consistent with our focus on long-term objectives, our long-term incentive plan is based on total corporate world-wide  performance. A three-year performance cycle is established each year with Officers receiving an award if minimum pre-  determined (by the Compensation Committee) performance goals are achieved at the end of each annual cycle. As a pay for  performance plan, the long-term incentive plan is intended to motivate and reward executives by directly linking the amount  of any award to specific long-term corporate financial goals and total team performance. There is a direct shared relationship  between what a retail owner receives in patronage rebate and what the Officer group receives as an award pool.             The President and CEO participates in the base salary, Retail Sales Incentive and Long-Term Incentive Plan  compensation programs described in this report consistent with our compensation philosophy. At risk compensation  represents a major portion of the President and CEO's total compensation package. The President and CEO's compensation  includes a competitive base salary, a significant long-term incentive award to maintain our commitment to long-term company  performance and shareholder return and a retail sales award.        Compensation of Directors                 Effective January 1, 2002, each member of the Board of Directors (other than the Chairman of the Board) received a  monthly fee of $3,083 for their services, which was increased to $3,208 per month effective January 1, 2003. Each member of  the Board of Directors (other than the Chairman of the Board) also receives $1,500 per Board of Directors meeting attended.  In addition, each Board of Director Committee Chairperson receives $1,000 per meeting chaired. Mr. Jung is paid an annual  fee of $155,000 in his capacity as Chairman of the Board.             The Company has adopted a Directors' Deferral Option Plan. Like the Officers' Long-Term Incentive Compensation  Deferral Option Plan, under this Directors' Plan, directors may elect to defer a portion (5% to 100%, in 5% increments) of  their annual director's fee. Deferred benefits are payable over a period of 5 to 20 years, as elected. Annual elections are  required for the upcoming deferral year by December 15 of the preceding year.             Each member of the Board is also reimbursed for the amount of travel and lodging expenses incurred in attending  meetings of the Board and of the Committees of the Board. The expenses incurred by them in attending the semi-annual  conventions and exhibits which the Company sponsors are also paid by the Company. Each member of the Board is also paid  $300 per diem compensation for special committee meetings and nominating committee regional trips attended.        Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management                 No shares of our stock are held by any of our officers except for the shares held by Mr. Jung. He is a director, but his  position as Chairman of the Board is also an executive officer position under Article VIII Section 1 of our By-laws. We are  not aware of anyone who holds more than five percent of our outstanding voting stock, whether in their own names, or on  behalf of someone else.             The table below shows the shares of our Class B and Class C Stock that is held (directly or indirectly), by our directors,  officers and nominees for directorships as of February 17, 2003:                                                                                                                            _Class B Stock Owned_          _Class C Stock Owned   _ Number        Percent          Number        Percent                                       _of Shares_    _of Class_       _of Shares_         _of Class_       Richard F.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions                The term "owner" as used in this section pertains to owners of our shares. It includes both those who are named as  owners of shares on our corporate books and records, as well as those who are not named as owners of record, but for whose  benefit someone else is holding the shares. No director, executive officer or shareholder whom we know to be the owner of  more than five percent of any class of our voting securities or any member of their immediate families had during fiscal year  2002 or is currently expected to have any significant interest (whether direct or indirect) in any transaction over $60,000 with  us, except that those of our directors who are also Ace Hardware dealers purchased merchandise and services from us and  participated in our programs for their stores, including but not limited to our lending programs, in the ordinary course of  business. None of these directors received special terms in connection with these transactions (including, but not limited to  our lending programs) or any benefits that were not available to the other cooperative members that we supply.        Item 14. Controls and Procedures                Our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation within 90 days of  the filing date of this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective for gathering, analyzing and disclosing  the information we are required to disclose in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There have been  no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to  the date of the previously mentioned evaluation.                                                                                                                   PART IV          Item 15.

These  consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an  opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.             We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts  and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant  estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits  provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.             In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of Ace Hardware Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, and the results of  their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2002 in conformity  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.         > > > > > >             KPMG LLP      Chicago,

CORPORATION                                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS           (1)        Summary of Significant Accounting Policies               (a)     The Company and Its Business            Ace Hardware Corporation (the Company) operates as a wholesaler of hardware and related  products, and  manufactures  paint products. As a dealer-owned cooperative, the Company distributes substantially all of its patronage sourced earnings in  the form of patronage dividends to member dealers based on their volume of merchandise purchases.             (b)    Cash Equivalents and Investments             The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash  equivalents. Short-term investments consist primarily of corporate and government agency bonds and are classified as  available for sale.             (c)    Consolidation            The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries. All  significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for the  Company's 50%  or less owned affiliates over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence.             (d)    Receivables          Receivables from dealers include amounts due from the sale of merchandise and special equipment used in the operation  of dealers' businesses. Other receivables are principally amounts due from suppliers for promotional and advertising  allowances.             (e)    Revenue Recognition          The Company's policy is to recognize revenues from product sales when earned, following the guidance in SEC Staff  Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101. Specifically, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement  exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue is not  recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, which is upon delivery of products. Provisions for  returns are made for at the time the related sales are recorded, and are reflected as a reduction of sales.             (f)    Inventories          Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined primarily using the last-in, first-out  method.             (g)    Property and Equipment          Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance,  repairs and renewals of relatively minor items are generally charged to earnings. Significant improvements or renewals are  capitalized.             Depreciation expense is computed on both straight-line and accelerated methods based on estimated useful lives as  follows:                                                                                                                                             Useful Life                    Principal                                                               _Years_     _Depreciation Method_    > Buildings and improvements 10-40              Straight line  Warehouse equipment 5-10              Accelerated  Office equipment 3-10              Various  Manufacturing equipment 3-20              Straight line  Transportation equipment 3-7                Straight line  Leasehold improvements are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective lease.             (h)    Foreign Currency Translation          Substantially all assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance  sheet date while revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates prevailing during the year. The  Company has utilized foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. equity investments. Gains and losses on these  foreign hedges are included in the basis of the underlying hedged investment. Foreign currency translation adjustments, net of  gains on foreign exchange contracts, are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  for 2002, 2001 and 2000. The Company did not have  any outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts at December 28,  2002 or December 29, 2001.             ( i)    Financial Instruments            The carrying value of assets and liabilities that meet the definition of a financial instrument included in the accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value.                ( j)     Retirement Plans            The Company has retirement plans covering substantially all non- union employees. Costs with respect to the  noncontributory pension plans are determined actuarially and consist of current costs and amounts to amortize prior service  costs and unrecognized gains and losses. The Company contribution under the profit sharing plan is determined annually by  the Board of Directors and charged to expense in the period it is earned by employees.               (k)    Use of Estimates            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual  results could differ from those estimates. With respect to the Company's discontinued operation, actual losses could differ  from those estimates and will be reflected as adjustments in future financial statements when probable and estimable.               (l)    Shipping and Handling Costs            Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs are included in net sales. Amounts incurred for shipping and  handling are included in cost of sales.               (m)    Fiscal Year            The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest December 31st. Accordingly, 2002, 2001 and 2000 ended on  December 28, 2002, December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, respectively.               (n)    Reclassifications            Certain financial statement reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to comparable  classifications followed in 2002. During 2002, the Company reclassified as sales and cost of sales certain shipping and  handling costs that had previously been presented on a net basis within distribution operations expenses and reclassified  certain amounts within selling, general and administrative expenses to distribution operations expenses. These  reclassifications had no effect on previously reported income.        (2)        Discontinued Operations                In August of 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets"   ("SFAS 144") which supercedes SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed O f  " . While SFAS 144 retains many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of  SFAS 121, it changes the criteria required to be met to classify an asset as held for sale. SFAS 144 also supercedes the  accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of  Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions", and  among other things, broadens reporting for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity, rather than just a  segment of a business. The Company adopted SFAS 144 in 2002, and applied its provisions in reporting discontinued  operations in 2002.           In 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to sell Ace  Hardware Canada Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary for  cash proceeds of approximately US $3.7 million and an interest bearing note of US $4.0 million. The transaction closed on  February 13, 2003, at which time the sale proceeds were received and used to repay outstanding indebtedness.            The Company recognized a loss related to the disposal of this discontinued operation of US $5.4 million in 2002. Losses  from operations of Ace  Hardware  Canada Limited were US $5.4 million in 2002, US $11.1 million in 2001 and US $723,000 in 2000.            The Company has classified the assets and liabilities of Ace Hardware  Canada Limited as held for sale in the accompanying  consolidated financial statements, and reclassified the financial statement and related notes for all periods presented to display  the operating results of this business as discontinued operations. For business segment reporting purposes, Ace Hardware  Canada Limited results were previously included in the "Wholesale" segment.            Net sales from the discontinued operation for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 were US $24.6 million, US $27.9 million  and US $75.3 million, respectively. Total assets of the discontinued operation for the years 2002 and 2001 were US $10.3  million and US $18.1 million, respectively. Total liabilities of the discontinued operation for the 2002 and 2001 were US $6.8  million and US $3.7 million, respectively.        (3)            Inventories               Inventories consist primarily of merchandise inventories. Substantially all of the Company's domestic inventories are   valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method; the excess of replacement cost over the LIFO value of inventory was  approximately $57,295,000 and $57,809,000 at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, respectively. Indirect costs,  consisting primarily of warehousing costs, are absorbed as inventory costs rather than period costs.        (4)            Short-Term Borrowings                At December 28, 2002 the Company has available a revolving credit facility with a group of banks providing for $175.0   million in committed lines of credit and also has available $10.0 million in uncommitted lines. The facility requires the  Company to comply with various financial covenants for which the Company was in compliance at December 28, 2002 and  December 29, 2001. The facility expires on May 2, 2005. The maximum amount outstanding at any month-end during the  period was $104.4 million in 2002 and $128.0 million in 2001. The monthly weighted average borrowing levels during 2002  and 2001 were $57.3 million and $77.9 million, respectively. The interest rate under the revolving credit facility is based  upon a spread over LIBOR based upon quarterly debt to EBITDA ratios. The weighted average interest rate effective as of  December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was 1.94% and 2.58%, respectively. Short- term borrowings outstanding as of  December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 were $48.9 million and $72.6 million, respectively. The aggregate unused line  of credit available at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was $136.1 million and $112.4 million, respectively. At  December 28, 2002 the Company had no compensating balance requirements.        (5)                Long-Term Debt                     Long-term debt is comprised of the following:                                                                                                                                          December 28,                    December 29,                                                     _       2002         _ _        2001         _                                                                        (000's omitted)           Notes Payable:        $20,000,000 due in quarterly installments of $540,500            with interest payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 8.74% and a            maturity date of July 1, 2003 $            1,622                        $           3,784      $30,000,000 due in semi-annual installments of $2,000,000            with interest payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 6.47% and a            maturity date of June 22, 2008 22,000                                   26,000       $20,000,000 due in quarterly installments of $714,300            commencing September 15, 2004 with interest payable quarterly            at a fixed rate of 7.49% and a maturity date of June 15, 2011 20,000                                   20,000       $30,000,000 due in annual installments of $6,000,000            commencing March 25, 2005 with interest payable quarterly            at a fixed rate of 7.55% and a maturity date of March 25, 2009 30,000                                   30,000       $25,000,000 due in annual installments of $5,000,000            commencing February 9, 2006 with interest payable quarterly            at a fixed rate of 6.61% and a maturity date of February 8, 2010 25,000                                   25,000       $70,000,000 due in annual installments of $14,000,000            commencing April 30, 2009 with interest payable semi-annually            at a fixed rate of 7.27% and a maturity date of April 30, 2013 70,000                                   70,000  Installment notes with maturities through 2006 at a fixed rate of 6.00%      _ __               __100  _                   _                2,754    _                                                                  168,722 177,538  Less current installments _             __(5,647) _                   _                (7,151)_                                                      $        163,075 $           170,387                                                       =========== ===========         The debt covenants on the notes payable are substantially consistent with the revolving credit facility. Aggregate  maturities of long-term debt are $5,647,000, $5,454,000, $12,882,000, $17,882,000 and $17,857,000 in 2003 through 2007,  respectively, and $109,000,000 thereafter.        (6)               Patronage Dividends and Refund Certificates Payable                  The Company operates as a cooperative organization and has paid or will pay patronage dividends to member dealers on   the portion of earnings derived from business done with such dealers. Patronage dividends are allocated in proportion to the  volume of purchases by member dealers during the period. The amount of patronage dividends to be remitted in cash depends  upon the level of dividends earned by each member outlet, ranging from 20% on the total dividends under $5,000 and  increasing by 5% on total dividends for each subsequent $2,500 earned to a maximum of 40% on total dividends exceeding  $12,500. Amounts exceeding the cash portion will be distributed in the form of Class C $100 par value stock, to a maximum  based upon the current year purchase volume or $20,000 whichever is greater, and thereafter in a combination of additional  cash and patronage refund certificates having maturity dates and bearing interest as determined by the Board of Directors. A  portion of the dealer's annual patronage dividends distributed under the above plan in a form other than cash can be applied  toward payment of principal and interest on any balances outstanding for approved patronage financing programs.             The patronage dividend composition for 2002, 2001 and 2000 follows:                                                                                                   Subordinated                    Class                    Patronage                    Total                                                               Cash Refund                     C                        Financing Patronage                                                            _Portion_ _Certificates_            _Stock_              _Deductions_ _Dividends_                                      _(000's omitted)_                            2002                               $38,687                  $20,651               $26,053                        $10,189                     $95,580                       2001                                 34,229 18,739                 23,284                            8,857 85,109                      2000                                 34,764 18,029                 24,267                            9,477 86,537         Patronage dividends are allocated on a fiscal year basis with issuance in the following year.         The patronage refund certificates outstanding or issuable at December 28, 2002 are payable as follows:                &nb sp;   Interest                         _January 1, _           _Amount_                                _Rate_                                              (000's omitted)                        2003 $13,196                                 6.00%                          2004                                                                                                      15,094                                 6.00%                           2005                                                                                                      12,232                                 6.25%                           2006                                                                                                      17,331                                 6.50%                           2007                                                                                                      18,512                                 6.00%                           2008                                                                                                          20,651                                 6.00%            (    7)    Retirement Plans             The Company has two defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all non-union employees, the Employees'  Pension Plan and Trust and the Employees' Retirement Income Plan and Trust. The Company terminated the Employees'  Pension Plan and Trust effective April 30, 2000. Benefits in these plans are based on years of service, highest average  compensation (as defined) and the related profit sharing and primary social security benefit. Contributions to the plans are  based on the Entry Age Normal, Frozen Initial Liability actuarial funding method and are limited to amounts that are currently  deductible for tax reporting purposes. As of December 28, 2002 plan assets in the Employees' Retirement Income Plan and  Trust were held in a group annuity contract.             Pension expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 included the following components:                                                                                                                December 28,                December 29,                December 30,                             _       2002         _               _        2001 _                _       2000        _                                                                    (000's omitted)                        Service cost - benefits earned during the                          period $            43                        $            41                       $ 52                      Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 121                                   116 112                      Expected return on plan assets (131)                                 (123) (115)                      Net amortization and deferral - -                                        - - (31)                      Gain on curtailment _                   - -      _               _                 (58)   _ _                  - -     _                      Net periodic pension expense (income)                    $ 33                         $          (24)                       $          18                            ===========                =========== ===========             The following table sets forth the funded status of the plans and amounts recognized in the Company's Consolidated  Balance Sheets at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001:                                                                     December 28, December 29,                                                                _        2002__ _                  _       __2001        _           (000's omitted)                         Change in benefit obligation:                          Benefit obligation at beginning of year $  1,714                               $  1,656                          Service cost 43                                        41                          Interest cost 121                                     116                          Actuarial losses 123                                        91                          Curtailment and settlements -                                       (141)                          Benefits paid _             __(67)      _                  _             (49)    _                      Benefit obligation at end of year _          __1,934__       _                  _          __1,714     _                      Change in plan assets:                          Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 1,645                                   1,560                          Actual return on plan assets 108                                         91                          Employer contribution 64                                          43                          Benefits paid _             __(67)__      _                  _               (49)__   _                      Fair value of plan assets at end of year _           __1,750__      _                  _            __1,645   _                          Funded status (184)                                      (69)                          Unrecognized transition asset 5                                           6                          Unamortized prior service cost (3)                                        (4)                          Unrecognized net actuarial losses _              __224__      _                  _                 __78   _                      Prepaid pension asset $            42                              $        11                                                                ============ ===========             The weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was  6.75% in 2002 and 7.25% in 2001. The related expected long-term rate of return was 8.0% in 2002 and 2001. The rate of  increase in future compensation was projected using actuarial salary tables plus 1.0% in 2002 and 2001.             Ace also participates in several multi-employer plans covering union employees. Amounts charged to expense and  contributed to the plans totaled approximately $304,000, $212,000 and $222,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.             The Company's profit sharing plan contribution for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was approximately $17,040,000, $14,253,000  and $14,586,000, respectively.        (8)    Income Taxes             As a cooperative, the Company distributes substantially all of its patronage sourced earnings to  its members in the form of patronage dividends. The 2002, 2001 and 2000 provisions (benefit) for federal income taxes were  $(756,000), $3,037,000 and $(162,000), respectively, and for state income taxes were $289,000, $381,000 and $289,000,  respectively.             The Company made tax payments of $374,000, $807,000 and $1,095,000 during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Upon voluntary or  involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy, Class B and Class C shareholders would first receive amounts to repurchase the shares  at prices previously set by the Company's Board of Directors from the net assets of the Company. If the available net assets  are not sufficient, each outstanding share of Class B and Class C stock will share in the distribution of the Company's net  assets in proportion to its purchase or redemption price to the total available for payment.             Member dealers may subscribe for the Company's stock in various prescribed combinations. Only one share of Class A  Stock may be owned by a dealer with respect to the first member retail outlet controlled by such dealer. Only four shares of  Class B Stock may be owned by a dealer with respect to each retail outlet controlled by such dealer, but only if such outlet  was a member of the Company on or before February 20, 1974. An appropriate number of shares of Class C Stock must be  included in any subscription by a dealer in an amount to provide that such dealer has a par value of all shares subscribed for  equal to $5,000 for each retail outlet. Unregistered shares of Class C Stock are also issued to dealers in connection with  patronage dividends. No dividends can be declared on any shares of any class of the Company's Stock.             Upon termination of the Company's membership agreement with any retail outlet, all shares of stock of the Company  held by the dealer owning or controlling such outlet, must be sold back to the Company, unless a transfer of such shares is  made to another party accepted by the Company as a member dealer with respect to the same outlet.             A Class A share is issued to a member dealer only when the share subscribed has been fully paid. Class B and Class C  shares are only issued when all such shares subscribed with respect to a retail outlet have been fully paid. Additional stock  subscribed in the accompanying statements represents the par value of shares subscribed, reduced by the unpaid portion.             All shares of stock are currently issued and repurchased at par value, except for Class B Stock which is repurchased at  twice its par value, or $2,000 per share. Upon retirement of Class B shares held in treasury, the excess of redemption price  over par is allocated equally between contributed capital and retained earnings.             Treasury stock transactions during 2000, 2001 and 2002 are summarized below:                                                                                                                                                       _Shares Held in Treasury_                                             _Class A_                    _Class B_                    _Class C_     Balance at January 1, 2000                                                                                - -                              4,067                            - -       Stock issued - -                                 - -                                - -      Stock repurchased 307                             180                        141,365      Stock retired _  (307)  _                      _     - -      _ _(141,365)_  Balance at December 30, 2000 - -                              4,247                            - -      Stock issued - -                                 - -                                 - -      Stock repurchased 260                             144                        144,584      Stock retired _  (260)  _                      _     - -      _ _(144,584)_  Balance at December 29, 2001 - -                                4,391                             - -      Stock issued - -                                   - -                                  - -      Stock repurchased 247                              164                        151,070      Stock retired _  (247)  _                      _     - -      _                    _ (151,070)_  Balance at December 28, 2002 - -                                4,555                            - -                                            ======                    ====== =======        (10)    Segments             The Company is principally engaged as a wholesaler of hardware and related products and is a manufacturer of paint  products.

It is  the purpose and intention of the parties to this Lease that the Basic Rent due hereunder shall be  absolutely net to Landlord and that this Lease shall yield, net to Landlord, the Basic Rent  provided in this Lease. Tenant waives all rights which are not expressly stated herein, but which  may now or hereafter otherwise be conferred by law to quit, terminate or surrender this Lease or  any of the Premises, to any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, abatement, suspension, deferment,  diminution, deduction, reduction or defense of or to Basic Rent, Additional Rent or any other  sums payable under this Lease, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, and for any  statutory lien or offset right against Landlord or its property.                             (b)        Landlord and Tenant agree that this Lease is a true lease and does not  represent a financing arrangement.

It is  understood and agreed that Tenant shall make its own arrangements for the installation or  provision of all such utilities and that Landlord shall be under no obligation to furnish any  utilities to the Premises and shall not be liable for any interruption or failure in the supply of any  such utilities to the Premises.                 6.        _Title and Condition_.                             (a)        The Premises are demised and let subject to the Permitted Encumbrances  and all Legal Requirements and Insurance Requirements, including any existing violation of any  thereof, without representation or warranty by Landlord; it being understood and agreed,  however, that the recital of the Permitted Encumbrances herein shall not be construed as a revival  of any thereof which for any reason may have expired.                             (b)        Without limiting the effect of Landlord's covenant set forth in_  Paragraph 8(c)_, the Landlord makes no, and expressly hereby denies any, representations or  warranties regarding the condition or suitability of, or title to, the Premises. Tenant agrees that it  takes the Premises "_as is_," without any such representation or warranty. The Premises are leased  to Tenant in their present condition without representation or warranty by Landlord and subject  to the rights of parties in possession, to the existing state of title and any state of facts which an  accurate survey or physical inspection might reveal, to all applicable Legal Requirements now or  hereafter in effect and subject to the Permitted Encumbrances. Tenant has examined the  Premises and title to the Premises and has found all of the same satisfactory for all purposes.  Tenant acknowledges that immediately prior to this Lease it owned and occupied the Premises  and that Tenant is fully familiar with the physical condition of the Premises and that Landlord  makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to same. THE LEASE OF  THE PREMISES IS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, IT BEING AGREED THAT TENANT WILL  LEASE THE PREMISES IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION, WITH ALL FAULTS.  LANDLORD HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR  PURPOSE RELATIVE TO THE PREMISES OR ANY COMPONENT PART THEREOF.  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that no representations or warranties have been made by  Landlord, or by any person, firm or agent acting or purporting to act on behalf of Landlord, as to  (i) the presence or absence on or in the Premises of any particular materials or substances  (including, without limitation, asbestos, hydrocarbons or hazardous or toxic substances), (ii) the  condition or repair of the Premises or any portion thereof, (iii) the value, expense of operation or  income potential of the Premises, (iv) the accuracy or completeness of any title, survey, structural  report, environmental audit or other information provided to Tenant by any third party contractor  relative to the Premises (regardless of whether the same were retained or paid for by Landlord),  or (v) any other fact or condition which has affected or might affect the Premises or the  condition, repair, value, expense of operation or income potential thereof. Tenant represents that  the officers of Tenant are knowledgeable and experienced in the leasing of properties comparable  to the Premises and agrees that Tenant will be relying solely on Tenant's inspections of the  Premises in leasing the Premises. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH HAVE BEEN  NEGOTIATED AND ARE INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE EXCLUSION AND  NEGATION BY THE LANDLORD OF, AND THE LANDLORD DOES HEREBY  DISCLAIM, ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES BY THE LANDLORD, EXPRESS OR  IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PREMISES OR ANY PORTION THEREOF,  WHETHER ARISING PURSUANT TO THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE OR ANY  OTHER LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT OR OTHERWISE, AND TENANT  HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND ACCEPTS SUCH EXCLUSION, NEGATION AND  DISCLAIMER.                             (c)        Landlord hereby conditionally assigns, without recourse or warranty  whatsoever, to Tenant, all warranties, guaranties and indemnities, express or implied, and similar  rights which Landlord may have against any manufacturer, seller, engineer, contractor or builder  in respect of any of the Premises, including, but not limited to, any rights and remedies existing  under contract or pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code (collectively, the "guaranties").  Such assignment shall remain in effect so long as no Event of Default exists hereunder or until  the termination of this Lease. Landlord shall also retain the right to enforce any guaranties so  assigned in the name of Tenant upon the occurrence of an Event of Default. Landlord hereby  agrees to execute and deliver at Tenant's sole cost and expense such further documents,  including powers of attorney, as Tenant may reasonably request (and which in the good faith  judgment of Landlord, do not adversely affect a substantial general interest of Landlord), in order  that Tenant may have the full benefit of the assignment effected or intended to be effected by this  _Paragraph 6_. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or termination of this Lease, the  guaranties shall automatically revert to Landlord. The foregoing provision of reversion shall be  self-operative and no further instrument of reassignment shall be required. In confirmation of  such reassignment Tenant shall execute and deliver promptly any certificate or other instrument  which Landlord may request at Tenant's sole cost and expense. Any monies collected by Tenant  under any of the guaranties after the occurrence of and during the continuation of an Event of  Default shall be held in trust by Tenant and promptly paid over to Landlord.                             (d)        Landlord agrees to enter into with Tenant, at Tenant's expense, such  easements, covenants, waivers, approvals or restrictions for utilities, parking or other matters as  desirable for operation of the Premises or properties adjacent thereto (collectively, "Easements")  as requested by Tenant, subject to Lender's and Landlord's approval thereof, not to be  unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that no such Easement shall result in any  diminution in the value or utility of the Premises for its legal use and further provided that no  such Easement shall render the use of the Premises dependent upon any other property or  condition the use of the Premises upon the use of any other property or require payment or  performance by Landlord at any time, each of which Tenant shall certify to Landlord and Lender  in writing delivered with Tenant's request with respect to such Easement. Tenant's request shall  also include Tenant's written undertaking acknowledging that Tenant shall remain liable  hereunder as a principal and not merely as a surety or guarantor notwithstanding the  establishment of any Easement.                             (e)        _Encroachments_. In the event that any Improvement now or hereafter  constructed shall (i) encroach upon any property, street or right-of-way on or adjoining the  Premises, (ii) violate the provisions of any restrictive covenant affecting the Premises, (iii) hinder  or obstruct any easement or right-of-way to which the Premises is subject, or (iv) impair the  rights of others in, to or under any of the foregoing, then, promptly after written request of  Landlord, Tenant shall at Tenant's sole cost and expense either (x) obtain valid and effective  waivers or settlements of all claims, liabilities and damages at Tenant's sole cost and expense  resulting from each such encroachment, violation, hindrance, obstruction or impairment, whether  the same shall affect Landlord, Tenant or both, or (y) take such action as shall be necessary to  remove such encroachment, hindrance or obstruction and to end such violation or impairment. If  such action is in the form of an Alteration, such Alteration shall conform to the provisions of_  Paragraph 11_.                 7.        _Payment of Impositions and Additional Obligations; Compliance with Law_.                             (a)        _Impositions_. Subject to the provisions of _Paragraph 18_, and except as  otherwise provided in this _Paragraph 7(a)_, Tenant shall, before delinquency thereof, pay and  discharge the following whether the same became due and payable before, on or after the  Commencement Date (collectively, the "Impositions"): all taxes (including sales, use, and gross  rental taxes), assessments, levies, fees, water and sewer rents and charges, utilities and  communications taxes and charges and all other governmental charges, general and special,  ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen, which are, at any time, prior to or during the  Term, imposed upon or assessed against (i) the Premises, (ii) any Basic Rent, Additional Rent or  other sum payable hereunder, (iii) this Lease, the leasehold estate created hereby, (iv) Landlord,  Lender, or Tenant, as a result of or arising out of the ownership, acquisition, occupancy, leasing,  use, maintenance, management, repair, possession or operation of the Premises (including  without limitation, any taxes on revenues, rents, income, awards, proceeds, capital gains, profits,  excess profits, gross receipts, sales, use, excise and other taxes, duties or imports whether similar  or not in nature, assessed, levied or imposed against Tenant, Landlord or the Premises by any  governmental authority). If any assessment may be paid in installments, Tenant shall have the  option to pay such assessment in installments; in such event, Tenant shall be liable only for those  installments which become due and payable during the Term. Tenant shall prepare and file all  tax reports required by governmental authorities which relate to the Impositions. Tenant shall  upon Landlord's request, deliver to Landlord copies of all receipts for payment of Impositions.  Landlord shall either request the applicable taxing authority to deliver tax notices or tax bills  directly to Tenant, or provide Tenant with complete and correct copies of such tax notices or tax  bills promptly upon Landlord's receipt thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Impositions will  not include federal, state or local (i) franchise, capital stock or similar taxes, of Landlord, (ii) net  income, net rental, excess profits or other taxes, of Landlord, or (iii) any estate, inheritance,  succession, gift, capital levy or similar tax, unless such taxes referred to in clauses (i) and (ii)  above are in lieu of, or a substitute for, any tax, assessment, levy or charge which, if it were in  effect on the Commencement Date, would be payable by Tenant under this Lease. Upon the  expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Landlord and Tenant shall prorate any pre-paid  real property taxes applicable to the period after such expiration or termination date and any  unpaid real property taxes attributable to the period prior to such expiration or termination date.                             (b)        _Compliance with Law_. Subject to the provisions of _Paragraph 18_, Tenant  shall at all times comply with and cause the Premises to comply with and conform to all Legal  Requirements applicable to the Premises or its ownership, occupancy or use, including those  which require structural, unforeseen or extraordinary changes to the Premises. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Lease, Tenant shall not be required to make any structural  improvements to the Premises required by a change in Legal Requirements in effect as of the  date of this Lease.                             (c)        _Additional Obligations_. Tenant shall pay and perform all obligations of  Landlord, as the owner of the Premises, that may now or hereafter exist under any Permitted  Encumbrances or any other matter that would be a Permitted Encumbrance created by or with the  consent of Tenant.                 8.         _Use_.                             (a)        Tenant may use the Premises for any lawful purpose other than any use  that will (i) have a material adverse effect on the value of the Premises, (ii) materially increase  the likelihood that Tenant, Landlord or Lender would incur liability under any provisions of the  Act referred to in _Paragraph 27_ of this Lease, or (iii) result or give rise to any material  environmental deterioration or degradation of the Premises. In no event shall the Premises be  used for any purpose which shall violate any of the provisions of any recorded covenants,  restrictions or agreements applicable to the Premises. Tenant agrees that with respect to any such  recorded covenants, restrictions or agreements, Tenant shall observe, perform and comply with  and carry out the provisions thereof required therein to be observed and performed by Landlord.                             (b)        Subject to Tenant's rights of contest under _Paragraph 18_ hereof, Tenant  shall not permit any unlawful occupation, business or trade to be conducted on any of the  Premises or any use to be made thereof contrary to applicable Legal Requirements or Insurance  Requirements. Subject to Tenant's rights of contest under _Paragraph 18_ hereof, Tenant shall not  use, occupy or permit any of the Premises to be used or occupied, nor do or permit anything to be  done in or on any of the Premises, in a manner which would (i) violate any certificate of  occupancy or equivalent certificate affecting any of the Premises, (ii) make void or voidable any  insurance which Tenant is required hereunder to maintain then in force with respect to any of the  Premises, (iii) affect in any manner the ability of Tenant to obtain any insurance which Tenant is  required to furnish hereunder, (iv) cause any injury or damage to any of the Improvements unless  pursuant to Alterations permitted under _Paragraph 11_ hereof, or (v) constitute a public or private  nuisance or waste.                             (c)        Subject to all of the provisions of this Lease, so long as no Event of  Default exists hereunder, Landlord covenants that neither it nor any party claiming by, through or  under it, shall do any act to disturb the peaceful and quiet occupation and enjoyment of the  Premises by Tenant. Landlord may enter upon and examine any of the Premises at reasonable  times after reasonable notice and during business hours without notice and exercise any rights  and privileges granted to Landlord under the provisions of this Lease.                 9.        _Maintenance and Repair_.                             (a)        Except for any alterations that Tenant is permitted to make hereunder,  Tenant shall at all times, including any Requisition period, put, keep and maintain the Premises,  including, without limitation, the roof, roof membrane, landscaping, walls (interior and exterior),  footings, foundations, parking lots, plumbing, conveyor systems and structural and non-structural  components of the Premises, and the Adjoining Property, in good repair and appearance, and  shall promptly make all repairs and replacements (substantially equivalent in quality and  workmanship to the original work) of every kind and nature, whether foreseen or unforeseen,  which may be required to be made upon or in connection with any of the Premises in order to  keep and maintain the Premises in as good repair and appearance as they were as of the  Commencement Date, except for ordinary wear and tear. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant  shall not be required to make structural repairs or structural replacements to the Improvements,  the Land or Landlord's Trade Fixtures, unless such repair or replacement is needed because of  Tenant's act or failure to maintain such items. Tenant shall not be required to maintain the  Racking/Shelving Items in the Premises in the same condition as at the Commencement Date;  provided, however, that Tenant shall make any structural repairs or structural replacements  necessary to the Racking/Shelving Items so that the system is operable for its intended purpose.  Tenant shall do or cause others to do all that is necessary to plow or otherwise remove any and  all accumulated snow from the Premises and Adjoining Property and keep both in safe condition.  Tenant shall do or cause others to do all shoring of the Premises or Adjoining Property or of  foundations and walls of the Improvements and every other act necessary or appropriate for  preservation and safety thereof, by reason of or in connection with any excavation or other  building operation upon any of the Premises or Adjoining Property, whether or not Landlord  shall, by reason of any Legal Requirements or Insurance Requirements, be required to take such  action or be liable for failure to do so. Landlord shall not be required to make any repair,  whether foreseen or unforeseen, or to maintain any of the Premises or Adjoining Property in any  way, and Tenant hereby expressly waives the right to make repairs at the expense of the  Landlord, which right may otherwise be provided for in any law now or hereafter in effect.  Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to preclude Tenant from being entitled to  insurance proceeds or condemnation awards for Restoration pursuant to the terms of this Lease.  Tenant shall, in all events, make all repairs for which it is responsible hereunder promptly, but in  no event longer than thirty (30) days after a repair or replacement becomes prudent, and all  repairs shall be in a good, proper and workmanlike manner, and diligently pursued to completion.                             (b)        If Tenant shall be in default under any of the provisions of this_  Paragraph 9_, Landlord or Lender may, after thirty (30) days' notice to Tenant and failure of  Tenant to commence to cure during said period or to diligently prosecute such cure to completion  once begun, but immediately upon notice in the event of an emergency (that is, imminent danger  of injury to persons or property), do whatever is necessary to cure such default as may be  reasonable under the circumstances for the account of and at the expense of Tenant. In the event  of an emergency, before Landlord may avail itself of its rights under this _Paragraph 9(b)_,  Landlord shall send notice to Tenant of the situation by telephone or other available  communication. All actual and reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation,  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) so incurred by Landlord or Lender, together with  interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of payment or incurring the expense, shall  constitute Additional Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease and shall be paid by Tenant to  Landlord or Lender (as applicable) on demand. Tenant agrees that, in the event of an emergency,  expenditures which might otherwise be unreasonable (such as overtime) may nevertheless be  reasonable under the circumstances.                             (c)        Tenant shall from time to time replace with other similar operational  equipment or parts any of the mechanical systems or other equipment included in the  Improvements which shall have become worn out, obsolete or unusable for the purpose for which  it is intended, been taken by a Condemnation as provided in _Paragraph 12_, or been lost, stolen,  damaged or destroyed as provided in _Paragraph 14_. Tenant shall repair at its sole cost and  expense all damage to the Premises caused by the removal of equipment or any other personal  property of Tenant at any time, including upon expiration or termination of the Lease.                 10.        _Liens_.    Tenant will promptly remove and discharge any charge, lien, security  interest or encumbrance upon the Premises or any Basic Rent, Additional Rent or other sums  payable hereunder which arise for any reason, including all liens which arise out of the  possession, use, occupancy, construction, repair or rebuilding of the Premises or by reason of  labor or materials furnished or claimed to have been furnished to Tenant or for the Premises, but  not including (i) the Permitted Encumbrances, and (ii) any mortgage, charge, lien, security  interest or encumbrance created by Landlord on or after the Commencement Date without the  consent of Tenant. Nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed as constituting the consent  or request of Landlord, express or implied, to or for the performance by any contractor, laborer,  materialmen, or vendor of any labor or services or for the furnishing of any materials for any  construction, alteration, addition, repair or demolition of or to the Premises or any part thereof  which would result in any liability of the Landlord for payment thereof. Notice is hereby given  that Landlord will not be liable for any labor, services or materials furnished or to be furnished to  Tenant, or to anyone holding an interest in the Premises or any part thereof through or under  Tenant, and that no mechanic's or other liens for any such labor, services or materials shall attach  to or affect the interest of Landlord in and to the Premises.                 11.        _Alterations_.    Tenant shall not make any Alterations which would diminish the value  of the Premises or adversely affect any building systems or equipment. Tenant may make any  other Alterations without the prior written consent of the Landlord provided: (i) such Alterations  comply with all of the provisions of the following sentence and (ii) such Alterations are  nonstructural. All Alterations shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner, and shall  be expeditiously completed in compliance with all Legal Requirements. All work done in  connection with any such Alteration shall comply with all Insurance Requirements. Tenant shall  promptly pay all costs and expenses of any such Alteration, and shall discharge all liens filed  against any of the Premises arising out of the same. Tenant shall procure and pay for all permits  and licenses required in connection with any such Alteration. All such Alterations shall be the  property of Landlord and shall be subject to this Lease. All structural Alterations and any  Alteration the estimated cost of which in any one instance exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars  ($50,000.00) shall be made under the supervision of a licensed architect or engineer in  accordance with detailed plans and specifications which shall be submitted to Landlord and  Lender at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of the Alterations. Upon completion  of any structural Alteration or one in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) Tenant will  provide as-built plans and specifications or record drawings to Landlord and Lender.                 12.        _Condemnation_.                             (a)        Immediately upon obtaining knowledge of the institution of any  proceeding for Condemnation, Tenant shall notify Landlord and Lender thereof and Landlord and  Lender shall be entitled to participate in any Condemnation proceeding at their own expense.  Landlord and Lender, immediately upon obtaining knowledge of the institution of any  proceeding for Condemnation, shall notify Tenant thereof and Tenant shall have the right to  participate in such proceedings at its own expense. Subject to the provisions of this _Paragraph 12  _and _Paragraph 15_, Tenant hereby irrevocably assigns to Lender or to Landlord, in that order, any  award or payment in respect of any Condemnation of Tenant's interest in the Premises, except  that nothing in this Lease shall be deemed to require (i) the assignment to Landlord or Lender of  any award or payment on account of Tenant's Trade Fixtures, or other tangible personal property,  moving expenses and similar claims, if available, to the extent Tenant shall have a right to make  a separate claim therefor against the condemnor or (ii) any act or circumstance that impairs  Tenant's right to any such award or payment; it being agreed, however, that Tenant shall in no  event be entitled to any payment that reduces the award to which Landlord is or would be entitled  for the condemnation of Landlord's interest in the Premises.                             (b)        If (i) the entire Premises or (ii) at least fifty percent (50%) of the Land or  the building constructed on the Land, the loss of which even after Restoration would, in Tenant's  reasonable business judgment, be substantially and materially adverse to the business operations  of Tenant, shall be the subject of a Taking, then Tenant shall have the right to, not later than sixty  (60) days after a Taking has occurred, serve notice upon Landlord ("Tenant's Termination  Notice") of its intention to terminate this Lease on any Basic Rent Payment Date specified in  such notice, which date (the "Termination Date") shall be no sooner than the first Basic Rent  Payment Date occurring at least thirty (30) days after the date of Tenant's Termination Notice  and not later than the third Basic Rent Payment Date occurring after the date of Tenant's  Termination Notice.                 In the event that Tenant shall serve Tenant's Termination Notice upon Landlord, this  Lease and the Term hereof shall terminate on the Termination Date. In such event the entire  award made in Condemnation proceeding shall be paid to Lender, or to Landlord, in that order.                             (c)        In the event of any Condemnation of part of the Premises which does not  result in a Termination of this Lease, subject to the requirements of _Paragraph 15_, the Net Award  of such Condemnation shall be retained by Landlord or Lender and, promptly after such  Condemnation, Landlord shall commence and diligently continue to perform the Restoration, but  only to the extent of that portion of the Net Award designated for such work.                 In the event of a Requisition of any of the Premises, Landlord shall apply the Net Award  of such Requisition, to the extent available, to the installments (proportionately in the same ratio  of the Premises taken to the otherwise whole Premises) of Basic Rent, Additional Rent or other  sums payable by Tenant hereunder thereafter payable and Tenant shall pay the balance remaining  thereafter. Upon the expiration of the Term, any portion of such Net Award that shall not  previously have been credited to Tenant on account of the Basic Rent and Additional Rent shall  be retained by Landlord or Lender.                             (d)        No agreement with any condemnor in settlement of or under threat of any  Condemnation shall be made by Tenant without the written consent of Landlord and of Lender, if  the Premises are then subject to a Mortgage, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed provided such award or payment is applied in accordance with this Lease.                 13.        _Insurance_.                             (a)        _Type of Insurance_. Tenant shall maintain at its sole cost and expense the  following insurance on the Premises:                                         (i)        Special Form property insurance (including flood insurance and  earthquake insurance each to the extent applicable and/or required by Lender; provided, however,  that the limit of any such earthquake insurance policy shall not be greater than $5,000,000)  against all risk of direct physical loss or damage to the Improvements in amounts not less than  the full replacement cost of the Improvements, if the same are actually replaced, or actual cash  value (replacement cost minus depreciation) if the same are not replaced, excluding footings and  foundations and other parts of the Improvements which are not insurable, with an "Amendment  of the Pollution Exclusion Endorsement" for damage caused by heat, smoke, or fumes from a  hostile fire. Tenant shall also obtain: (i) business interruption or rental interruption insurance, as  requested by Landlord, in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Basic Rent and  Additional Rent for a period of no less than eighteen (18) months and shall make any proceeds  therefrom available to Landlord and Lender, and (ii) ordinance and law coverage, including, but  not limited to, for extra costs and/or loss of value to the Premises because of any changes in  building codes.                                         (ii)        Commercial General Liability insurance against claims for bodily  injury, death or property damage occurring on, in, or about the Premises, which insurance shall:  (i) be written on a so-called "occurrence basis," with combined single limit coverage of not less  than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), or in such increased limits as Landlord may  reasonably request from time to time and (ii) include premises and operations liability coverage,  products and completed operations liability coverage, blanket contractual liability coverage,  including, to the maximum extent possible, coverage for the indemnification obligations of  Tenant under this Lease, a "severability of interest" clause or endorsement which precludes the  insurer from denying the claim of Tenant or Landlord because of the negligence or other acts of  the other, and personal and advertising injury coverage. Policies for such insurance shall be for  the mutual benefit of Landlord, Tenant and any Lender.                                         (iii)        Workers' compensation insurance covering all persons employed in  connection with any work done on or about the Premises (or in lieu of such workers'  compensation insurance, a program of self-insurance complying with the rules, regulations and  requirements of the appropriate agency of the State), including employer's liability coverage with  limits of at least Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) with "stop gap" and "all states"  endorsements.                                         (iv)        Any other insurance coverage that is customarily carried by owners  or tenants of similar properties in the same geographic area and engaged in businesses similar to  Tenant's business or that may from time to time be reasonably required by Landlord or by Lender  in order to protect their respective interests.                             (b)        _Insurance Requirements_. The insurance required by _Paragraph 13(a)_ shall  be written by companies, licensed to do business in the State, of recognized financial standing  which are rated A- or better by A. M. Best Company or A3 or better by Moody's Investors  Services, in either case with asset size rating of "VIII" or better by A. M. Best Company. The  insurance shall (i) be for a term of not less than twelve (12) months; (ii) be in amounts sufficient  at all times to satisfy any co-insurance requirements thereof; (iii) provide an "Additional Insured-  Managers or Lessors of Premises Endorsement"; (iv) provide that the insurance company has the  duty to defend all insureds under the policy; (v) provide that defense costs are paid in addition to  and do not deplete any of the policy limits; (vi) (except for the workers' compensation insurance  referred to in _Subparagraph 13(a)(iii)_ above) name Landlord, Tenant, and any Lender as insured  parties as their respective interests may appear; (vii) provide that such insurance cannot be  canceled, invalidated, or suspended on account of the conduct of Tenant, its officers, directors,  employees, or agents; (viii) provide that any "no other insurance" clause in the insurance policy  shall exclude any policies of insurance maintained by Landlord and the insurance policy shall not  be brought into contribution with insurance maintained by Landlord; (ix) provide that the policy  of insurance shall not be terminated, canceled or substantially modified without at least thirty  (30) days' prior written notice to Landlord, Lender and to any other lender covered by any  standard mortgage clause endorsement; (x) provide that the insurer shall not have the option to  restore the Premises if Landlord elects to terminate this Lease in accordance with the terms  hereof; (xi) provide that the interests of Landlord and Lender shall not be invalidated by any  action or inaction of the Landlord, Tenant, or any other person, and such insurance shall insure  the Lender regardless of any breach or violation by the Tenant, the Landlord, or any other person  of any warranties, declarations, or conditions contained in the policies relating to such insurance  or application therefore; and (xii) provide that all insurance proceeds payable under any policy of  property, sprinkler, or flood insurance with respect to the Premises shall be paid to Lender as sole  loss payee under a standard mortgagee clause (or if no Lender exists, to Landlord). If said  insurance or any part thereof shall expire, be withdrawn, become void by breach of any condition  thereof by Tenant, or become void or unsafe by reason of the failure or impairment of the capital  of any insurer, or if for any other reasonable cause said insurance shall become unsatisfactory to  Landlord or Lender, Tenant shall promptly obtain new or additional insurance satisfactory to  Landlord and Lender. Tenant shall provide Landlord with certificates of insurance (ACORD  Form 27) of all such insurance policies; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any  event insured by such an insurance policy, or if otherwise required by Lender, Tenant shall  provide Landlord with a copy of such insurance policy.                             (c)        Each insurance policy referred to above shall, to the extent applicable,  contain standard non-contributory mortgagee clauses in favor of any Lender. As evidence of the  insurance specified in _Paragraph 13(a)(i)_, required to be maintained by Tenant, Tenant shall  deliver to Landlord an ACORD 27 Evidence of Property Insurance or other certificate providing  at least the same assurances (or, if limited by Legal Requirements, then a certificate providing as  many of the same assurances as allowed by applicable law). As evidence of the insurance  specified in _Paragraph 13(a)(ii)_ and _(iii)_, required to be maintained by Tenant, Tenant shall  deliver to Landlord an ACORD 25 Certificate of Insurance or other certificate providing at least  the same assurances. The coverage provided by Tenant in respect of each policy shall also  provide that any loss otherwise payable thereunder shall be payable notwithstanding (i) any act or  omission of Landlord, Lender or Tenant which might, absent such provision, result in a forfeiture  of all or a part of such insurance payment, (ii) the occupation or use of any of the Premises for  purposes more hazardous than permitted by the provisions of such policy, (iii) any foreclosure or  other action or proceeding taken by any Lender pursuant to any provision of the Mortgage upon  the happening of an event of default therein, or (iv) any change in title or ownership of any of the  Premises.                             (d)        Tenant shall pay as they become due all premiums for the insurance  required by this _Paragraph 13_, shall renew or replace each policy prior to the expiration date  stated on the policy then in effect, and shall deliver to Landlord and Lender the appropriate  assurances for such renewals or replacements in accordance with the provisions of this_  Paragraph 13(d)_ before expiration of the then-effective coverage. In the event of Tenant's failure  to comply with any of the foregoing requirements of this _Paragraph 13_ within five (5) days of  written notice from Landlord, Landlord or Lender shall be entitled to procure such insurance.  Any sums expended by Landlord or Lender, as the case may be, in procuring such insurance shall  be Additional Rent and shall be repaid by Tenant, together with interest thereon at the Default  Rate, from the time of payment by Landlord or Lender, as the case may be, until fully paid by  Tenant immediately upon written demand therefor by Landlord or Lender, as the case may be.                             (e)        Anything in this _Paragraph 13_ to the contrary notwithstanding, any  insurance which Tenant is required to obtain pursuant to _Paragraph 13(a)_ may be carried under a  "blanket" policy or policies covering other properties or liabilities of Tenant, provided that such  "blanket" policy or policies otherwise comply with the provisions of this _Paragraph 13_. In the  event any such insurance is carried under a blanket policy, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord and  Lender a certified copy of those provisions of the blanket policy that pertain to the Premises, if  any, to evidence the issuance and effectiveness of the policy, the amount and character of the  coverage with respect to the Premises and the presence in the policy of provisions of the  character required in the above sections of this _Paragraph 13_.                             (f)        With respect to any risk covered by property damage insurance, except for  any obligations arising under this Lease, Landlord and Tenant hereby waive any rights each may  have against the other on account of any loss or damage occasioned to Landlord or to Tenant, as  applicable, their respective property, the Improvements, or their contents, or to other  improvements, to the extent of any insurance proceeds received by the waiving party for such  loss or damage. The parties each, on behalf of their respective insurance companies insuring the  property of either Landlord or Tenant against any such loss, waive any right of subrogation that  they may have against Landlord or Tenant, as applicable.                 14.        _Damage, Destruction_.                             (a)        In the event of any casualty loss exceeding Ten Thousand Dollars  ($10,000.00), Tenant shall give Landlord and Lender immediate notice thereof. Tenant shall  adjust, collect and compromise any and all such claims, with the consent of Lender and Landlord,  not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and Landlord and Lender shall have the right to join  with Tenant therein. All proceeds of any insurance shall be paid to a Trustee which shall be a  federally insured bank or other financial institution, selected by Landlord and Tenant and  reasonably satisfactory to Lender (the "Trustee"). If the Premises shall be covered by a  Mortgage, Lender, if it so desires, shall be the Trustee. Each insurer is hereby authorized and  directed to make payment under said policies directly to such Trustee instead of to Landlord and  Tenant jointly, and Tenant hereby appoints such Trustee as Tenant's attorney- in-fact to endorse  any draft therefor for the purposes set forth in this Lease after approval by Tenant of such  Trustee, if Trustee is other than Lender, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or  delayed.                             (b)        In the event of any casualty (whether or not insured against) resulting in  damage to (i) the entire Premises or (ii) at least fifty percent (50%) of the Premises, the loss of  which even after Restoration would, in Tenant's reasonable business judgment, be substantially  and materially adverse to the business operations of Tenant, Tenant shall have the right, not later  than sixty (60) days after such casualty has occurred, to serve a Tenant's Termination Notice  upon Landlord. If Tenant shall serve a Tenant's Termination Notice upon Landlord, this Lease  shall terminate on the Termination Date, which shall be as set forth in _Paragraph 12(b)_, specified  in such Termination Notice; however, Tenant shall assign and make available to Landlord all  insurance proceeds for such casualty and pay to Landlord any deductible therefor, before any  such Termination becomes effective. If this Lease is not terminated pursuant to this _Paragraph  14(b)_, Landlord shall commence and diligently continue to perform the Restoration to the  Premises. Tenant shall be responsible for any deductible under any insurance required under_  Paragraph 13_. Upon the Trustee's receipt of the entire proceeds of any insurance required under  _Paragraph 13_, together with any self-insurance payment required of Tenant, less any expenses  incurred by Landlord, Tenant, or any Lender in collecting such proceeds or payment ("Net  Proceeds"), the Trustee shall, to the extent available, make the Net Proceeds available to  Landlord for Restoration, in accordance with the provisions of _Paragraph 15_.                             (c)        In the event that any damage or destruction shall occur at such time as  Tenant shall not have maintained third-party insurance in accordance with _Paragraph 13(a)(i)_,  Tenant shall pay to the Trustee the amount of the proceeds that would have been payable had  such insurance program been in effect (the "Tenant Insurance Payment").                 15.        _Restoration_.    The Net Proceeds and Tenant Insurance Payment (the aggregate of  which and any interest being herein defined as the "Restoration Fund") paid to the Trustee shall  be disbursed by the Trustee to Landlord. Landlord shall only be obligated to restore the Premises  to the extent of the funds Landlord receives from the Restoration Fund. Any sum in the  Restoration Fund which remains in the Restoration Fund upon the completion of Restoration  shall be paid to Tenant.                 16.        _Subordination to Financing_.                             (a)        Subject to the following provisions of this _Paragraph 16(a)_, Tenant agrees  that this Lease shall, upon Landlord's and Lender's (if any) written request, be subject and  subordinate to the lien of any Mortgage, and Tenant agrees, upon demand, without cost, to  execute instruments as may be required to further effectuate or confirm such subordination. So  long as no Event of Default shall be outstanding, Tenant's tenancy shall not be disturbed, nor  shall this Lease be affected by any default under such Mortgage, and in the event of a foreclosure  or other enforcement of any such Mortgage, or sale in lieu thereof, the purchaser at such  foreclosure sale shall be bound to Tenant for the Term of this Lease and any extensions thereof,  the rights of Tenant hereunder shall expressly survive, and this Lease shall in all respects  continue in full force and effect so long as no Event of Default by Tenant has occurred and is  continuing. So long as no Event of Default by Tenant has occurred and is continuing, Tenant  shall not be named as a party defendant in any such foreclosure suit, except as may be required  by law.                             (b)        Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this _Paragraph 16_, the  holder of the Mortgage to which this Lease is subject and subordinate, as provided in said  subdivision (a), shall have the right, at its sole option, at any time, to subordinate and subject the  Mortgage, in whole or in part, to this Lease by recording a unilateral declaration to such effect.                             (c)        At any time prior to the expiration of the Term, Tenant agrees, at the  election and upon demand of any owner of the Premises, or of Lender who has granted non-  disturbance to Tenant pursuant to _Paragraph 16(a)_ above, to attorn, from time to time, to any  such owner or Lender, upon the then executory terms and conditions of this Lease, for the  remainder of the term originally demised in this Lease and for any renewal term, provided that  such owner or Lender shall then be entitled to possession of the Premises subject to the  provisions of this Lease. The provisions of this subdivision (c) shall enure to the benefit of any  such owner or Lender, shall apply notwithstanding that, as a matter of law, this Lease may  terminate upon the foreclosure of the Mortgage, shall be self-operative upon any such demand,  and no further instrument shall be required to give effect to said provisions.                             (d)        Tenant and Landlord agree that, if requested by the other, each shall,   without charge, enter into (i) a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement  reasonably requested by Lender, provided such agreement contains provisions relating to non-  disturbance in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (a), and (ii) an agreement with  Lender whereby Tenant shall agree for the benefit of Lender that Tenant will not, without in each  case the prior written consent of Lender, (a) amend, modify, cancel or surrender the term of this  Lease except as expressly permitted by the provisions of this Lease, or enter into any agreement  with Landlord so to do, or (b) pay any installment of Basic Rent more than one (1) month in  advance of the due date thereof or otherwise than in the manner provided for in this Lease.                             (e)        At any time after Landlord has advised Tenant of the existence of a  "Lender" hereunder, and before such Lender has confirmed to Tenant that the lien of its  Mortgage has been released, Tenant shall not (and shall not be obligated, even upon the request  of Landlord, to) execute any agreement or document purporting to subordinate this Lease to the  lien of any mortgage or deed of trust other than the Mortgage held by Lender.                 17.        _Assignment, Subleasing_.                             (a)        Tenant is currently in occupancy and is operating its business at the  Premises. Tenant may not assign its interest in this Lease or sublease any portion(s) of the  Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed. No sublease under, or assignment or other transfer of, this Lease shall  relieve Tenant of its obligations hereunder, which shall continue as the obligations of a principal  and not as the obligations of a surety or a guarantor. The joint and several liability of Tenant  named herein and any immediate and remote successor in interest of Tenant (by assignment or  otherwise), and the due performance of the obligations of this Lease on Tenant's part to be  performed or observed, shall not in any way be discharged, released or impaired by any (i)  agreement which modifies any of the rights or obligations of the parties under this Lease, (ii)  stipulation which extends the time within which an obligation under this Lease is to be  performed, (iii) waiver of the performance of an obligation required under this Lease, or (iv)  failure to enforce any of the obligations set forth in this Lease, unless in each case, the same has  been consented to by Landlord and Lender.                             (b)        Each sublease of the Premises or any part thereof shall be subject and  subordinate to the provisions of this Lease. Tenant agrees that in the case of an assignment,  Tenant shall, not less than ten (10) days prior to the execution and delivery of any such  assignment as described in this _Paragraph 17(b)_, give notice of such assignment to Landlord.  Tenant further agrees that in the case of such assignment, Tenant shall, within fifteen (15) days  after the execution and delivery of any such assignment, deliver to Landlord (i) a duplicate  original of such assignment in recordable form and (ii) an agreement executed and acknowledged  by the assignee in recordable form wherein the assignee shall agree to assume and agree to  observe and perform all of the terms and provisions of this Lease on the part of the Tenant to be  observed and performed from and after the date of such assignment, and, in the case of a  sublease, Tenant shall, within fifteen (15) days after the execution and delivery of such sublease,  deliver to Landlord a duplicate original of such sublease.                             (c)        Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Lease, Landlord  shall have the right to collect and enjoy all rents and other sums of money payable under any  sublease of any of the Premises, and Tenant hereby irrevocably and unconditionally assigns all  rights under any such sublease including rents and money to Landlord, which assignment may be  exercised upon and after (but not before) the occurrence of an Event of Default.                             (d)        Any sublease shall provide that upon notice from Landlord and Lender of  an Event of Default, all rent due under such sublease shall be paid as so directed. In no event  shall Landlord or Lender have the right to direct the payment of sublease rents to any party other  than Tenant except in an aggregate amount equal to or less than the aggregate amounts due  hereunder.                 18.        _Permitted Contests_.    Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary,  after prior written notice to Landlord and Lender and provided Landlord shall not have elected to  terminate this Lease as a result of an Event of Default, Tenant shall not be required to (i) pay any  Tax, (ii) comply with any Legal Requirement, or (iii) discharge or remove any lien, so long as  Tenant shall contest, in good faith and at its expense, the existence, the amount or the validity  thereof, the amount of the damages caused thereby, or the extent of its or Landlord's liability  therefor, by appropriate proceedings which shall operate during the pendency thereof to prevent  (v) the collection of, or other realization upon, the Tax or lien so contested, (w) the sale,  forfeiture or loss of any of the Premises, any Basic Rent or any Additional Rent to satisfy the  same or to pay any damages caused by the violation of the same, (x) any interference with the use  or occupancy of any of the Premises, (y) any interference with the payment of any Basic Rent or  any Additional Rent, and (z) the cancellation of any fire or other insurance policy. In no event  shall Tenant pursue any contest with respect to any Tax, Legal Requirement, or lien referred to  above in such manner that exposes Landlord, Tenant or Lender to any criminal liability, penalty  or sanction or material civil liability for which Tenant has not made provisions reasonably  acceptable to Landlord and Lender. Tenant shall be deemed to have made provisions reasonably  acceptable to Landlord and Lender if Tenant shall have provided Lender or Landlord in that order  as security for such contest, an amount of cash or bond equal to one hundred twenty-five percent  (125%) of the amount being contested, or other security satisfactory in the reasonable opinion of  Lender or Landlord in that order, in assuring the payment, compliance, discharge, removal or  other action, including all costs, attorneys' fees, interest and penalties, in the event that the  contest is unsuccessful. While any such proceedings are pending and the required security is  held by Lender or Landlord, in that order, Lender or Landlord, as the case may be, shall not have  the right to pay, remove or cause to be discharged the Tax, Legal Requirement or lien thereby  being contested unless Landlord or Lender reasonably believes that any one or more of the  conditions in subdivisions (v) through (z) shall not be prevented during the pendency of the  contest. Tenant further agrees that each such contest shall be promptly and diligently prosecuted  to a final conclusion, except that Tenant shall, so long as all of the conditions of the first sentence  of this _Paragraph 18_ are at all times complied with, have the right to attempt to settle or  compromise such contest through negotiations. Tenant shall pay any and all judgments, decrees  and costs (including all attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with any such contest and  shall, promptly after the final determination of such contest, fully pay and discharge the amounts  which shall be levied, assessed, charged or imposed or be determined to be payable therein or in  connection therewith, together with all penalties, fines, interest, costs and expenses thereof or in  connection therewith, and perform all acts the performance of which shall be ordered or decreed  as a result thereof.                 19.        _Default_.    The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute  an Event of Default under this Lease:                             (a)        Tenant's failure to make any payment of Basic Rent, Additional Rent or  other sum herein required to be paid by Tenant when due which continues unremedied for a  period of three (3) business days after notice thereof from Landlord or Lender; provided,  however, that neither Landlord nor Lender shall have any obligation to give Tenant notice of  such failure if Landlord or Lender has given such notice to Tenant three (3) times in any  consecutive twelve (12) month period.                             (b)        An event occurs which is described in _Paragraph 21_ (Bankruptcy;  Insolvency) or Tenant causes, or gives cause for, the institution of any bankruptcy or receivership  proceedings as are described in _Paragraph 21_.                             (c)        The estate or interest of Tenant in any of the Premises shall be levied upon  or attached in any proceeding and such estate or interest is about to be sold or transferred or such  process shall not be vacated or discharged within forty-five (45) days after such levy or  attachment.                             (d)        A default occurs pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.                             (e)        Tenant's failure to duly perform and observe, or Tenant's violation or  breach of, any other provision hereof not identified in (a) through (d) above, if such failure shall  continue for a period of thirty (30) days after notice thereof from Landlord or Lender, or if such  failure cannot be cured within such period of thirty (30) days, such period shall be extended for  such longer time as reasonably necessary provided that Tenant has commenced to cure such  default within said period of thirty (30) days and is actively, diligently and in good faith  proceeding with continuity to remedy such failure.                 20.        _Landlord's Remedies_.    After the occurrence of an Event of Default by Tenant,  Landlord shall have the right to exercise the following remedies:                             (a)        Landlord may, at its option, continue this Lease in full force and effect,  without terminating Tenant's right to possession of the Premises, in which event Landlord shall  have the right to collect Basic Rent and all other rent and charges when due. In the alternative,  Landlord shall have the right to peaceably re-enter the Premises on the terms set forth in  subparagraph (b) below, but without such re-entry being deemed a termination of the Lease or an  acceptance by Landlord of a surrender thereof. Landlord shall also have the right, at its option,  from time to time, without terminating this Lease, to relet the Premises, or any part thereof, with  or without legal process, as the agent, and for the account, of Tenant upon such terms and  conditions as Landlord may deem advisable in its sole and absolute discretion (which terms may  be materially different from the terms of this Lease), in which event the rents received on such  reletting shall be applied (i) first to the reasonable and actual expenses of such reletting and  collection, including without limitation necessary renovation and alterations of the Premises,  reasonable and actual attorneys' fees and any reasonable and actual real estate commissions paid,  and (ii) thereafter toward payment of all sums due or to become due Landlord hereunder. If a  sufficient amount to pay such expenses and sums shall not be realized or secured, then Tenant  shall pay Landlord any such deficiency monthly, and Landlord may bring an action therefor as  such monthly deficiency shall arise. Landlord shall not, in any event, be required to pay Tenant  any sums received by Landlord on a reletting of the Premises in excess of the rent provided in  this Lease, but such excess shall reduce any accrued present or future obligations of Tenant  hereunder. Landlord's re-entry and reletting of the Premises without termination of this Lease  shall not preclude Landlord from subsequently terminating this Lease as set forth below.                             (b)        Landlord may terminate this Lease by written notice to Tenant specifying a  date therefor, and this Lease shall then terminate on the date so specified as if such date had been  originally fixed as the expiration date of the Term. In the event of such termination, Landlord  shall be entitled to recover from Tenant the worth at the time of the award of all of the following:                                         (i)        Any obligation which has accrued prior to the date of termination,  plus                                         (ii)        The amount of unpaid Basic Rent and all other charges which  would have accrued after termination until the time of award.                                         (iii)        The amount of unpaid rent for the balance of the Term (excluding  any option periods or portions thereof not previously exercised).                 As used in this _Paragraph 20(b)_ the term, "worth at the time of the award," shall be  computed by allowing simple interest at the Default Rate for past due obligations, and using a  discount rate equal to the federal discount rate per annum on anticipated future obligations, on  the amount of the obligations payable on the date of such calculation. In the event this Lease  shall be terminated as provided above, by summary proceedings or otherwise, Landlord, its  agents, servants or representatives may immediately or at any time thereafter peaceably re-enter  and resume possession of the Premises and remove all persons and property therefrom, by  summary dispossession proceedings.                 In the event Landlord has any duty to mitigate damages hereunder following an Event of  Default and in any action or claim by Landlord or Lender against Tenant due to breach of this  Lease following an Event of Default, Landlord shall not be required to construct, repair, modify  or install any improvements in the Premises or to divide the Premises for multiple leaseholds in  any way whatsoever.                             (c)        Landlord may recover from Tenant, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon  demand, as Additional Rent such reasonable and actual expenses as Landlord may incur  in recovering possession of the Premises, placing the same in good order and condition and  repairing the same for reletting, and all other reasonable and actual expenses, commissions and  charges incurred by Landlord in exercising any remedy provided herein or as a result of any  Event of Default by Tenant hereunder (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees),  provided that in no event shall Landlord be obligated to incur any such expenses or take any such  action in order to mitigate Tenant's damages.                 Except as provided in _Paragraph 9_ or _13(d)_, at any time upon prior notice to Tenant,  Landlord and Lender shall have the right, but shall not be required, to pay such sums or do any  act which requires the expenditure of monies which may be necessary or appropriate by reason of  the failure or neglect of Tenant to comply with any of its obligations under this Lease (Landlord  and Lender shall not, however, exercise any such rights unless the failure or neglect shall have  ripened into an Event of Default), and in the event of the exercise of such right by Landlord or  Lender, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord or Lender forthwith upon demand, as Additional Rent,  all such sums including reasonable attorneys fees, together with interest thereon at the Default  Rate.                             (d)        The various rights and remedies reserved to Landlord herein, are  cumulative, the rights and remedies described in _Paragraph 20(a)-(d)_ shall survive termination of  this Lease and Landlord may pursue any and all such rights and remedies and any other available  to Landlord under applicable law or equity, whether at the same time or otherwise (to the extent  not inconsistent with specific provisions of this Lease); provided, however, that no remedy of  termination shall be available to Landlord except as expressly set forth in _Paragraph 20(b)_ after  the occurrence of an Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,  Landlord expressly waives its right to forcibly dispossess Tenant from the Premises, whether  peaceably or otherwise, without judicial process, such that Landlord shall not be entitled to any  "commercial lockout" or any other provisions of applicable law which permit landlords to  dispossess tenants from commercial properties without the benefit of judicial review.                 21.        _Bankruptcy; Insolvency_.                             (a)        _Immediate Default_.    Tenant shall be deemed to be in default under this  Lease (without Landlord giving any notice declaring such), upon the occurrence of an "Event of  Bankruptcy," which for the purposes of this Lease shall mean where Tenant or any part of the  Premises are placed in the hands of a receiver or trustee, or should Tenant file a voluntary  petition in bankruptcy, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, become unable to or  admit in writing that it cannot pay its debts as such become due, or be finally adjudicated a  bankrupt or insolvent, or should Tenant petition or institute any proceedings under the United  States Bankruptcy Code or under any other state or federal act or law relating to the subject of  bankruptcy wherein Tenant seeks to be adjudicated a bankrupt, or to be dismissed of its debts, or  to effect a plan of dissolution, liquidation, readjustment, composition, arrangement, or  reorganization, or should any involuntary proceeding equivalent or similar to any of the  foregoing be filed against Tenant under any such bankruptcy laws, and not be dismissed within  sixty (60) days thereafter. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to each guarantor of this  Lease to the same extent as if the word "Tenant" were replaced by the name of such guarantor  throughout this Section, except that the first word hereof shall remain "Tenant."                             (b)        _Assumption of Lease_.    If an Event of Bankruptcy occurs, the receiver or  trustee of Tenant's bankruptcy estate or Tenant as a debtor-in-possession may assume the Lease,  and may subsequently assign it, only if it performs the following within sixty (60) days after the  date of the filing of the voluntary petition, the entry of the order for relief or the date of  conversion or admission of inability to pay debts as such become due (or such additional time as  a court of competent jurisdiction may grant, for cause, upon a motion made within the original  sixty (60) day period):                                         (i)        1 files a motion to assume the Lease with the appropriate court;                                         (ii)        satisfies each of every one of the following conditions which  Landlord and Tenant acknowledge to be commercially reasonable:                                         (iii)        cures all monetary and nonmonetary defaults under the Lease or  provides Landlord with Adequate Assurance (as defined in _Paragraph 21(c)_ below) that it will be  able to cure all monetary defaults under the Lease within ten (10) days and all nonmonetary  defaults within thirty (30) days from the date of assumption and actually so cures all such  monetary and nonmonetary defaults under the Lease within said time periods;                                         (iv)        compensates Landlord or provides Landlord with Adequate  Assurance that within ten (10) days after the date of assumption it will compensate Landlord for  any pecuniary loss that Landlord incurred as a result of the default of Tenant, the trustee or  debtor-in-possession, including without limitation, Landlord's reasonable costs and expenses,  including attorney's fees;                                         (v)        provides Landlord with Adequate Assurance of Future  Performance (as defined in _Paragraph 21(c)_ below) of all Tenant's future obligations under the  Lease; and                                         (vi)        delivers to Landlord a written statement that the conditions in this_  Paragraph 21(b)_ have been satisfied.                             (c)        _Need for Adequate Assurance and Adequate Assurance of Future Performance_.                                         (i)        For the purposes only of _Paragraph 21(b)_ above, and in addition to  any other requirements under the Bankruptcy Code, any future federal bankruptcy laws and  applicable case law, "Adequate Assurance" shall mean at least entering an order segregating  sufficient cash to pay Landlord under _Paragraph 21(b)_ above and granting to Landlord a valid  first lien and security interest (in a form acceptable to Landlord) in Tenant's property or its  bankruptcy estate, which lien and security interest secures the receiver's, trustee's or  debtor-in-possession's obligation to cure the monetary and nonmonetary defaults under the Lease  within the periods set forth in _Paragraph 21(b)_ above.                                         (ii)        For the purposes only of _Paragraph 21(b)_ above, and in addition to  any other requirements under the Bankruptcy Code, any future federal bankruptcy law and  applicable case law, "Adequate Assurance of Future Performance" shall mean at least:                                         (iii)        the receiver, trustee, or debtor-in-possession depositing with  Landlord, as security for the timely payment of rent and other monetary obligation, an amount  equal to the sum of two (2) months' Basic Rent;                                         (iv)        the receiver, trustee or debtor-in-possession agreeing to pay in  advance, on each day that the Basic Rent is payable;                                         (v)        the receiver, trustee or debtor-in-possession providing adequate  assurance, in a form acceptable to Landlord, of the source of the rent and other consideration due  under the Lease;                                         (vi)        Tenant's bankruptcy estate and the receiver, trustee or  debtor-in-possession, providing adequate assurance, in a form acceptable to Landlord, that the  bankruptcy estate (and any successor after the conclusion of Tenant's bankruptcy proceedings)  will continue to have sufficient unencumbered assets after the payment of all secured obligations  and administrative expenses to assure Landlord that the bankruptcy estate (and any successor  after the conclusion of Tenant's bankruptcy proceedings) will have sufficient funds to fulfill  Tenant's obligations under the Lease and to keep the Premises properly staffed with sufficient  employees to conduct a fully operational, actively promoted business on the Premises.                             (d)        _Assignment of Lease_.                                         (i)        If the receiver, trustee or debtor-in-possession assumes the Lease  under _Paragraph 21(b)_ above and applicable law, it may assign its interest in this Lease only if  the proposed assignee first provides Landlord with Adequate Assurance of Future Performance  of all of Tenant's obligations under the Lease and if Landlord determines in the exercise of its  reasonable business judgement that the assignment of the Lease will not breach any other Lease,  mortgage, financing agreement, or other agreement relating to the Premises by which Landlord is  bound (and Landlord is not required to obtain consents or waivers from any third party required  under any Lease, mortgage or financing agreement or other agreement by which Landlord is  bound);                                         (ii)        For purposes of this _Paragraph 21(d)(ii)_ only, and in addition to  any other requirements under the Bankruptcy Code, any future bankruptcy law and applicable  case law, "Adequate Assurance of Future Performance" shall mean at least the satisfaction of the  following conditions which Landlord and Tenant agree and acknowledge to be commercially  reasonable;                                         (iii)        the proposed assignee submitting a current financial statement,  audited by a certified public accountant, that shows a tangible net worth and working capital in  amounts determined in the reasonable business judgment of Landlord to be sufficient to assure  the future performance by the assignee of all Tenant's obligations under the Lease;                                         (iv)        if requested by Landlord in the exercise of its reasonable business  judgment, the proposed assignee obtaining a guarantee (in form and substance satisfactory to  Landlord) from one or more persons who satisfy Landlord's standards of credit worthiness;                                         (v)        the proposed assignee submitting written evidence satisfactory to  Landlord in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, of substantial business experience  in operating facilities similar to the Premises.                             (e)        _Debtors' Obligations_.    Upon the filing of a petition by or against Tenant  under any bankruptcy provision, Tenant, as debtor and debtor-in-possession, and any trustee who  may be appointed agree to adequately protect Landlord as follows: (i) to perform each and every  obligation of Tenant under this Lease until such time as this Lease is either rejected or assumed  by bankruptcy court order; (ii) to pay currently all monetary obligations required under this  Lease, including without limitation, the payment of all sums payable hereunder which are  considered to be reasonable compensation for the use and occupancy of the Premises; and (iii) to  provide Landlord a minimum of thirty (30) days' written notice, unless a shorter period is agreed  to in writing by the parties, of any proceeding relating to any assumption of this Lease or any  intent to abandon the Premises, which abandonment shall be deemed a rejection of this Lease.                 22.        _Notices_.    All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals, offers, statements and  other instruments or communications required or permitted to be given pursuant to the provisions  of this Lease (collectively "Notice" or "Notices") shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have  been given for all purposes (i) three (3) days after having been sent by United States mail, by  registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the other party  at its address as stated below, (ii) one (1) day after having been sent by Federal Express or other  nationally recognized air courier service, or (iii) upon receipt after having been personally  delivered, to the Addresses stated below:                             (a)        If to Landlord, at the address set forth on the first page of this Lease.                             (b)        If to Tenant:                                         Ace Hardware Corporation                                      2200 Kensington Court                                      Oak Brook, Illinois 60523-2100                                      Attention: Corporate Property Manager                                            _With a copy to_:                                         Ace Hardware Corporation                                      2200 Kensington Court                                      Oak Brook, Illinois 60523-2100                                      Attention: John Van Zeyl, Esq.     If any Lender shall have advised Tenant by Notice in the manner aforesaid that it is the holder of  a Mortgage and stating in said Notice its address for the receipt of Notices, then simultaneously  with the giving of any Notice by Tenant to Landlord, Tenant shall serve one or more copies of  such Notice upon Lender in the manner aforesaid and no Notice shall be effective unless and  until Lender shall be sent a copy thereof. For the purposes of this Paragraph, any party may  substitute its address by giving fifteen days' notice to the other party in the manner provided  above; however, Tenant must provide a street address within the State for personal delivery.                 23.        _Memorandum Lease; Estoppel Certificates_.    Tenant shall execute, deliver and  record, file or register from time to time all such instruments as may be required by any present  or future law in order to evidence the respective interests of Landlord and Tenant in any of the  Premises, and shall cause a memorandum of this Lease, substantially in the form attached hereto  as _Exhibit B_ (the "Memorandum"), and any supplement hereto or to such other instrument, if  any, as may be appropriate, to be recorded, filed or registered and re- recorded, refiled or re-  registered in such manner and in such places as may be required by any present or future law in  order to give public notice and protect the validity of this Lease. In the event of any discrepancy  between the provisions of said recorded memorandum of this Lease or any other recorded  instrument referring to this Lease and the provisions of this Lease, the provisions of this Lease  shall prevail. Tenant shall, at any time and from time to time, within twenty (20) days after  written request by Landlord (or, in the case of an estoppel certificate, within twenty (20) days  after written request of Landlord or Lender), execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other a  statement in writing, executed by Tenant or, if other than an individual, by a President, Vice  President or authorized general partner, principal officer or agent certifying (i) that this Lease is  unmodified and in full effect (or, if there have been modifications, that this Lease is in full effect  as modified, setting forth such modifications); (ii) the dates to which Basic Rent payable  hereunder has been paid; (iii) that to the knowledge of the party executing such certificate no  default by either Landlord or Tenant exists hereunder or specifying each such of which such party  may have knowledge; (iv) the remaining Term hereof; (v) that there are no proceedings pending  or threatened against Tenant before or by any court or administrative agency which if adversely  decided would materially and adversely affect the financial condition and operations of Tenant or  if any such proceedings are pending or threatened to said party's knowledge, specifying and  describing the same; and (vi) such other facts regarding the Lease, Premises or Tenant that are  reasonably requested by Landlord. It is intended that any such statements may be relied upon by  Lender, the recipient of such statements or their assignees or by any prospective mortgagee,  purchaser, or assignee of Landlord.                 24.        _Surrender and Holding Over_.    Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this  Lease, Tenant shall peaceably leave and surrender the Premises (except as to any portion thereof  with respect to which this Lease has previously terminated) to Landlord in the same condition in  which the Premises were originally received from Landlord at the commencement of this Lease,  except as to the Racking/Shelving Items as set forth in _Paragraph 9(a)_, any repair or Alteration as  permitted or required by any provision of this Lease, and except for ordinary wear and tear and  damage by fire, casualty or condemnation but only to the extent Tenant is not required to repair  the same hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, within one (1) year after the  Commencement Date, Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense: (a) repair the roof to a  Serviceable Condition (as defined on _Exhibit D_ attached hereto and incorporated herein by this  reference) and (b) repair the deferred maintenance items set forth in paragraph two of Landlord's  letter of February 21, 2002, a copy of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ and incorporated  herein by this reference). Prior to the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall,  at Tenant's sole cost and expense, remove the Racking/Shelving Items from the Building and  repair any damage caused by such removal including without limitation capping all in-rack  sprinklers, cutting all bolts and leaving the floor in a smooth condition. Tenant may remove at  Tenant's sole cost and expense from the Premises on or prior to such expiration or earlier  termination Tenant's Trade Fixtures and personal property which are owned by Tenant or third  parties other than Landlord, and Tenant at its expense shall, on or prior to such expiration or  earlier termination, repair any damage caused by such removal. Tenant's Trade Fixtures and  personal property not so removed at the end of the Term or within thirty days after the earlier  termination of the Term for any reason whatsoever shall become the property of Landlord, and  Landlord may thereafter cause such property to be removed from the Premises. Landlord shall  not in any manner or to any extent be obligated to reimburse Tenant for any property which  becomes the property of Landlord as a result of such expiration or earlier termination. Upon  such expiration or earlier termination, no party shall have any further rights or obligations  hereunder except as specifically provided herein.                 Any holding over by Tenant of the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of  the term of this Lease or any extensions thereof shall operate and be construed as tenancy from  month to month only, at one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Basic Rent reserved herein and  upon the same terms and conditions as contained in this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  any holding over without Landlord's consent for a period greater than thirty (30) days shall  entitle Landlord, in addition to collecting Basic Rent at a rate of two hundred percent (200%)  thereof, to exercise all rights and remedies provided by law or in equity, including the remedies  of _Paragraph 20_. During any holding over by Tenant of the Premises, Tenant shall be obligated  to pay Landlord, in addition to Basic Rent as set forth in this _Paragraph 24_, all Additional Rent  due under this Lease.                 25.        _No Merger of Title_.    There shall be no merger of this Lease nor of the leasehold  estate created by this Lease with the fee estate in or ownership of any of the Premises by reason  of the fact that the same person, corporation, firm or other entity may acquire or hold or own,  directly or indirectly, (i) this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease or any interest in  this Lease or in such leasehold estate and (ii) the fee estate or ownership of any of the Premises  or any interest in such fee estate or ownership. No such merger shall occur unless and until all  persons, corporations, firms and other entities having any interest in (x) this Lease or the  leasehold estate created by this Lease and (y) the fee estate in or ownership of the Premises  including, without limitation, Lender's interest therein, or any part thereof sought to be merged  shall join in a written instrument effecting such merger and shall duly record the same.                 26.        _Landlord and Lender Exculpation_.    Anything contained herein to the contrary  notwithstanding, any claim based on or in respect of any liability of Landlord under this Lease  shall be enforced only against the Landlord's interest in Premises and shall not be enforced  against the Landlord individually or personally. Tenant agrees that any assignment by Landlord  of Landlord's interest in this Lease, or the rents payable hereunder, whether absolute or  conditional in nature or otherwise, which assignment is made to Lender solely as additional  collateral related to a mortgage, and the acceptance thereof by Lender shall never be treated as an  assumption by Lender of any obligations of Landlord hereunder unless Lender shall, by notice  sent to Tenant, specifically elect, and that Lender shall be treated as having assumed Landlord's  obligations hereunder only upon purchase of the Premises pursuant to foreclosure of the  Mortgage or by deed in lieu thereof, or other conveyance, and then only subject to the limitations  set forth in the first sentence hereof.                 27.        _Hazardous Substances_.                             (a)        Tenant represents, warrants and covenants that it will not on, about, or  under the Premises, make, treat or dispose of any "hazardous substances" as that term is defined  in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the rules  and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, as from time to time amended, 42 U.S.C. § 9601 _et  seq._ (the "Act"), but the foregoing shall not prevent the use to the extent necessary and customary  in normal operations of Tenant's business of any such substances in accordance with applicable  laws and regulations and Tenant represents, warrants and covenants that it will at all times  comply with the Act and any other federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations governing  Hazardous Materials. "Hazardous Materials" as used herein shall include, without limitation, all  "hazardous substances" (as defined in the Act), chemicals, petroleum, crude oil or any fraction  thereof, hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, asbestos- containing materials  and/or products, urea formaldehyde, or any substances which are classified as "hazardous" or  "toxic" under the Act; hazardous waste as defined under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as  amended 42 U.S.C. § 6901; air pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42  U.S.C. § 7401, _et seq._; pollutants as defined under the Clean Water Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C.  § 1251, _et seq._, any pesticide as defined by Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act,  as amended, 7 U.S.C. § 136, _et seq._, any hazardous chemical substance or mixture or imminently  hazardous substance or mixture regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act, as amended, 15  U.S.C. § 2601, _et seq._, any substance listed in the United States Department of Transportation  Table at 45 CFR 172.101; any chemicals included in regulations promulgated under the above  listed statutes or any modifications thereof or successor statutes thereto; any explosives,  radioactive material, and any chemical regulated by state statutes similar to the federal statutes  listed above and regulations promulgated under such state statutes.                             (b)        To the extent required by the Act and/or any federal, state or local laws,  rules or regulations governing Hazardous Materials, Tenant shall remove any Hazardous  Materials whether now or hereafter existing on the Premises and whether or not arising out of or  in any manner connected with Tenant's occupancy of the Premises during the Initial Term or any  extension or renewal Term thereof. Tenant shall and hereby does agree to defend, indemnify and  hold Lender and Landlord, their members, officers, directors, shareholders, partners and  employees harmless from and against any and all causes of actions, suits, demands or judgments  of any nature whatsoever, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, expenses, fees, claims, costs  (including response and remedial costs), and liabilities, including, but not limited to, attorneys'  fees and expenses and costs of litigation, arising out of or in any manner connected with (i) the  violation of any applicable federal, state or local environmental law with respect to the Premises  or (ii) the "release" or "threatened release" of, or failure to remove as required by this_  Paragraph 26_, Hazardous Materials on or from the Premises or any portion or portions thereof,  now or hereafter existing during the initial term and any extension or renewal Term whether or  not arising out of or in any manner connected with Tenants' occupancy of the Premises during  the Initial Term or any extension or renewal Term. Tenant's indemnification obligations under  this _Paragraph 27(b)_ are in addition to, and in no way limit, Tenant's indemnification obligations  under _Paragraph 35_.                             (c)        Tenant shall not engage in any activity in or on the Premises which  constitutes a Reportable Use of Hazardous Materials without the express prior written consent of  Landlord and timely compliance (at Tenant's sole cost and expense) with all applicable Legal  Requirements. "Reportable Use" shall mean (i) the installation or use of any above or below  ground storage tank; (ii) the generation, possession, storage, use, transportation, or disposal of a  Hazardous Materials that requires a permit from, or with respect to which a report, notice,  registration, or business plan is required to be filed with, any governmental authority; and/or (iii)  the presence at the Premises of any Hazardous Materials with respect to which any applicable  Legal Requirement requires that a notice be given to persons entering or occupying the Premises  or neighboring properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may use any ordinary and  customary materials reasonably required to be used in the normal course of Tenant's business (in  compliance with the use set forth in _Paragraph 8_ above) so long as such use is in compliance with  all applicable Legal Requirements, is not a Reportable Use, and does not expose the Premises or  neighboring property to any meaningful risk of contamination or damage or expose Landlord to  any liability therefor. In addition, Landlord may condition its consent to any Reportable Use  upon receiving such additional assurances as Landlord reasonably deems necessary to protect  itself, the public, the Premises, and/or the environment against damage, contamination, injury,  and/or liability, including, but not limited to, the installation (and removal on or before Lease  expiration or termination) of protective modifications (such as concrete encasements). Tenant  will not store combustible or flammable materials on the Premises in violation of the Act and any  other federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations governing Hazardous Materials. The  provisions of this _Paragraph 27_ shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.                 28.        _Entry by Landlord and Lender_.    Landlord, Lender and their authorized  representatives shall have the right upon reasonable notice (which shall be not less than twenty-  four (24) hours except in the case of emergency) to enter the Premises at all reasonable business  hours, (and at all other times in the event of an emergency), for (i) the purpose of inspecting the  same, including, but not limited to, conducting soil, hydrology, environmental, and all other  testing and examinations it deems necessary, or for the purpose of doing any work under_  Paragraph 9_, and may take all such action thereon as may be necessary or appropriate for any  such purpose (but nothing contained in this Lease or otherwise shall create or imply any duty  upon the part of Landlord or Lender to make any such inspection or do any such work), and (ii)  the purpose of showing the Premises to prospective purchasers and mortgagees and, at any time  within twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the term of this Lease for the purpose of  showing the same to prospective tenants. No such entry shall constitute an eviction of Tenant but  any such entry shall be done by Landlord in such reasonable manner as to minimize any  disruption of Tenant's business operation.                 29.        _Statements_.    Tenant named herein shall submit to Lender and Landlord within 90  days of the end of each fiscal year, annual balance sheets, income and cash flow statements for  Tenant named herein, certified by an independent public accountant. Copies of the l0Ks filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission will satisfy the requirement contained in this_  Paragraph 29_. The obligations of Tenant named herein shall continue whether or not this Lease  shall have been assigned.                 30.        _No Usury_.    The intention of the parties being to conform strictly to the usury laws  now in force in the State, whenever any provision herein provides for payment by Tenant to  Landlord of interest at a rate in excess of the legal rate permitted to be charged, such rate herein  provided to be paid shall be deemed reduced to such legal rate.                 31.        _Broker_.    Landlord and Tenant each hereby represents and warrants to the other that  no brokers represented Landlord and Tenant with respect to this Lease. Each party hereby agrees  to indemnify, protect, hold harmless and defend the other against all claims by any party for  broker fees, finder fees or any other fee or commission in connection with this Lease based upon  the actions of the indemnifying party.                 32.        _Waiver of Landlord's Lien_.    Landlord hereby waives any right to distrain Tenant's  Trade Fixtures or any property of Tenant and any Landlord's lien or similar lien upon Tenant's  Trade Fixtures and any other property of Tenant regardless of whether such lien is created or  otherwise. Landlord agrees, at the request of Tenant, to execute a waiver of any Landlord's or  similar lien for the benefit of any present or future holder of a security interest in or lessor of any  of Tenant's Trade Fixtures or any other personal property of Tenant. Landlord acknowledges  and agrees in the future to acknowledge (in a written form reasonably satisfactory to Tenant) to  such persons and entities at such times and for such purposes as Tenant may reasonably request  that Tenant's Trade Fixtures are Tenant's property and not part of Improvements (regardless of  whether or to what extent such Tenant's Trade Fixtures are affixed to the Improvements) or  otherwise subject to the terms of this Lease; however, Landlord shall not be obligated or  responsible to notify any such person of Tenant's default hereunder or keep safe any such  Tenant's Trade Fixtures for the benefit of any such person, or allow any sales or auctions of such  Tenant's Trade Fixtures on the Premises, and any such person shall be obligated to pay to  Landlord rental or moving or storage fees incurred by Landlord for such Tenant's Trade Fixtures  after the termination of this Lease and to repair any damage to the Premises caused by such  person's removal of any Tenant's Trade Fixtures. Tenant shall be obligated to pay Landlord's  attorney fees for the review and/or preparation of any such acknowledgment.                 33.        _No Waiver_.    No delay or failure by either party to enforce its rights hereunder shall  be construed as a waiver, modification or relinquishment thereof.                 34.        _Separability_.    If any term or provision of this Lease or the application thereof to any  provision of this Lease or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall to any  extent be invalid and unenforceable, the remainder of this Lease, or the application of such term  or provision to person or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or  unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term and provision of this Lease shall be  valid and shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.                 35.        _Indemnification_.    Tenant agrees to defend, pay, protect, indemnify, save and hold  harmless Landlord, Landlord's members, partners, officers, directors, shareholders, employees  and agents, and Lender (collectively, "Indemnitees") from and against any and all liabilities,  losses, damages, penalties, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses),  causes of action, suits, claims, demands or judgments of any nature whatsoever, howsoever  caused, arising from any of the Premises or Adjoining Property, the use, non- use, occupancy,  condition, design, construction, maintenance, repair or rebuilding of any of, or otherwise relating  to, the Premises or Adjoining Property, the failure to perform any of Tenant's obligations under  this Lease, and any injury to or death of any person or persons or any loss of or damage to any  property, real or personal, in any manner arising therefrom connected therewith or occurring  thereon (collectively, "Losses"), whether or not any of the Indemnitees has or should have  knowledge or notice of the defect or conditions, if any, causing or contributing to said Loss. In  case any action or proceeding is brought against any of the Indemnitees by reason of any such  Loss, Tenant covenants upon notice from any of the Indemnitees to defend such Indemnitee in  such action, with the expenses of such defense paid by Tenant, and such Indemnitee will  cooperate and assist in the defense of such action or proceeding if reasonably requested so to do  by Tenant. The obligations of Tenant under this _Paragraph 35_ shall survive any termination of  this Lease.                 36.        _Headings_.    The paragraph headings in this Lease are used only for convenience in  finding the subject matters and are not part of this Lease or to be used in determining the intent of  the parties or otherwise interpreting this Lease.                 37.        _Modifications_.    This Lease may be modified, amended, discharged or waived only  by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such  modification, amendment, discharge or waiver is sought. Each of Tenant and Landlord agrees  that it will not modify or amend this Lease without the written consent of Lender within any  period during which there is a Lender hereunder. In the event of any inconsistent instruction  from Landlord and Lender, Tenant shall comply with instruction of Lender.                 38.        _Successors, Assigns_.    The covenants of this Lease shall run with the Land and bind  Tenant, the heirs, distributees, personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns of  Tenant and all present and subsequent encumbrancers and subtenants of any of the Premises, and  shall inure to the benefit of and bind Landlord, its successors and assigns. In the event Tenant is  comprised of more than one individual or entity, the obligation of each shall be joint and several.  The term "Landlord" as used in this Lease, so far as covenants or obligations on the part of  Landlord are concerned, shall be limited to mean and include only the owner or owners of the  Premises or holder of the Mortgage in possession at the time in question of the Premises and in  the event of any transfer or transfers of the title of the Premises, the Landlord herein named (and  in case of any subsequent transfers or conveyances, the then grantor) shall be automatically freed  and relieved from and after the date of such transfer and conveyance of all personal liability as  respects the performance of any covenants or obligations on the part of Landlord contained in  this Lease thereafter to be performed.                 39.        _Counterparts_.    This Lease may be executed in several counterparts, which together  shall be deemed one and the same instrument.                 40.        _Governing Law_.    This Lease shall be governed by and construed according to the  laws of the State.                                                             [Signatures follow immediately]                    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Landlord and Tenant have caused this instrument to be  executed as of June 19, 2002.

Tenant and Landlord acknowledge that Base Rent shall initially be as set  forth in Paragraph 3 below with additional payments pursuant to Paragraph 4 below and, upon  the occurrence of the Break Date (as defined below), as set forth in Section 5 below.     2.        _Defined Terms_. For purposes of this _Exhibit D_ and the Lease, the following terms shall  have the following meanings:                 (i)        "Ace Lease Rent" shall mean the Ace Lease Square Foot Rent plus the  "Additional Rent" (as defined in the Ace Lease) and any other expenses required to be paid by  Tenant as tenant pursuant to the Ace Lease for the portion of the Existing Improvements which is  subject to the Ace Lease.

If Landlord and Tenant cannot agree on such alternative  index, then the matter shall be submitted for decision to the American Arbitration Association in  accordance with the then rules of the American Arbitration Association and the decision of the  arbitrators shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant. Cost of any such arbitration shall be paid  equally by Landlord and Tenant.                 (ix)        "H-P Lease Surrendered Square Footage" means the square footage of the H-P  Lease space the possession of which has been delivered by the H-P to Tenant.                 (x)        "Title Company" shall have the meaning attributed to such term in the Option  Agreement.                 (xi)        "Title Policy" shall have the meaning attributed to such term in the Option  Agreement.                 Any other terms beginning with an initial capital letter and not otherwise defined in this_  Exhibit D_ shall have the meaning attributable to such term in the Lease.     3.        _Base Rent Prior to Break Date_.

Tenant shall not be obligated to  pay "Additional Rent" for any such other space during any time that Tenant is refurbishing such  space and is not otherwise using such space for distribution or related activities, plus                 (v)        From and after delivery to Tenant of possession of the Advantage Logistics Lease  space and prior to the Break Date, an amount equal to Two Thousand Seventy Dollars  ($2,070.00) which is $0.046 multiplied by the rentable square feet of the Advantage Logistics  Lease space (45,000 square feet), which amount Landlord and Tenant acknowledge includes the  pro rata share of the real property taxes and assessments to be paid for such premises, plus                 (vi)        From and after delivery to Tenant of possession of the California Distribution  Lease space and prior to the Break Date, an amount equal to One Thousand One Hundred Fifty  Dollars ($1,150.00) which is $0.046 multiplied by the rentable square feet of the California  Distribution space (25,000 square feet), which amount Landlord and Tenant acknowledge  includes the pro rata share of the real property taxes and assessments to be paid for such  premises plus                 (vii)        The difference between H-P's Tenant's Proportionate Share of Operating  Expenses (both as defined in the H-P Lease) prior to delivery of the H-P Surrendered Square  Footage to Tenant and H-P's Tenant's Proportionate Share of Operating Expenses subsequent to  delivery of the H-P Surrendered Square Footage to Tenant. Landlord shall provide to Tenant at  least ten (10) days written notice of the amount due from Tenant to Landlord on account of the  foregoing along with reasonable backup information.     4.        _Expenses and Other Matters Relating to the Existing Leases_. Prior to the Break Date  Landlord shall continue to be responsible as the landlord under the PG&E Lease, the H-P Lease,  the Advantage Logistics Lease and the California Distribution Lease and shall perform all duties  and obligations and receive such benefits as are set forth therein, including, but not limited to,  collection of rent, receipt of reimbursements, and payment of expenses and liabilities. So long as  KMS is acting as Tenant's construction manager, Landlord shall be responsible for any claims  made by the tenants under the PG&E Lease, Advantage Logistics Lease and California  Distribution Lease that the construction by Tenant of the Tenant Improvements interferes with  the use of their respective premises and/or destroys their respective right to the quiet enjoyment  thereof. The responsibility under the H-P Lease for any claims made by H-P that construction by  Tenant of the Tenant Improvements interferes with the use of the H-P Lease premises and/or H-  P's right of quiet enjoyment thereof shall be addressed in the written agreement among Landlord,  Tenant and H-P as contemplated below in this Paragraph 4. Ace shall reasonably conduct its  construction activities at the Property in a manner to minimize as much as possible any  interference with the use of their respective premises and quiet enjoyment thereof by other  tenants at the Property.                 Prior to the Break Date, Landlord and Tenant shall cooperate so that the cost of electricity  used within the Advantage Logistics Lease space, California Distribution Lease space and H.P.  Lease Surrendered Square Footage after delivery to Tenant is charged to Tenant. Such  cooperation may include electronic metering or carve-out of electrical circuits so that Tenant's  usage of electricity in such spaces can be accurately determined.                 It shall be Landlord's sole responsibility and cost to terminate, and obtain possession of  the space subject to, the Advantage Logistics Lease and the California Distribution Lease and  deliver possession of such space to Tenant no later than March 1, 2003 or, in the event of a  holdover, as soon thereafter as possible. Such responsibility shall include the obligation to pay  any expenses incident to such termination.                 Landlord and Tenant agree to cooperate in negotiations with H-P in an effort to reduce  the square footage of the space subject to the H-P Lease. Any modifications to the H-P Lease as  a result of such negotiations shall be set forth in a written agreement signed by Landlord, Tenant  and H-P. Any sums payable to H-P in consideration of the modification of the H-P Lease shall  be paid by Tenant, including without limiting the foregoing, any costs incurred in connection  with the relocation of H-P and/or the reconstruction of H-P's tenant improvements.                 Prior to the Break Date, (i) subject to clause (ii) below, Landlord shall cause to be paid all  real property taxes and assessments allocable to the Property, and (ii) Tenant shall pay any  supplemental taxes and/or assessments attributable to construction of the Tenant Improvements.  With respect to any real property taxes and/or assessments for which Tenant is responsible,  Landlord shall deliver such bills to Tenant as soon as possible after received but no later than the  date which is five (5) business days prior to the last date on which such taxes may be paid  without incurring penalties.     5.        _Base Rent From and After Break Date_. From and after the Break Date and continuing  through the expiration of the Term (as the Term may be extended by Tenant's exercise of its  option rights pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Lease), Base Rent shall initially equal Two Million  Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) per year payable in twelve (12) equal increments  of Two Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($210,000) per month.                 Such annual Base Rent for the period after the Break Date shall be adjusted effective as  of each Adjustment Date.                 The annual Base Rent effective as of each Adjustment Date shall be determined by  multiplying the initial annual Base Rent of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars  ($2,500,000) by a fraction the denominator of which shall be the Base CPI and the numerator of  which is the most recently published CPI prior to the Adjustment Date in question. Landlord  shall provide the calculations of the adjustment in the annual Base Rent and monthly Base Rent  along with reasonable backup information relating thereto to Tenant as soon as possible. If  Tenant has not received the calculation of the adjusted annual Base Rent at least fifteen (15) days  prior to the Adjustment Date, Tenant shall continue to pay monthly Base Rent in the amount in  effect immediately prior to such Adjustment Date. In such event and within fifteen (15) days  after receipt of Landlord's calculation for the adjustment in Base Rent and any reasonable  backup information, Tenant shall pay the difference between the adjusted monthly Base Rent and  the monthly Base Rent paid to Landlord for those months which should have been previously  adjusted.        _  EXHIBIT "E"       __  FORM OF MEMORANDUM OF LEASE     _    RECORDING REQUESTED BY  AND WHEN RECORDED MAIL TO:     McDermott, Will & Emery  18191 Von Karman Avenue, Suite 500  Newport Beach, California 92612  Attn: Thomas K.

Upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer an exclusive option to purchase the Property ("Option").             1.2    _Term of Option_. The term of the Option shall commence on the date of this Agreement (as set forth in the introductory paragraph hereof), and shall expire at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on August 29, 2003 ("Option Termination Date"), unless previously exercised or cancelled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.             1.3    _Exercise of Option; Sale of Property_. Except as provided in Section 1.5, if Buyer elects to exercise the Option, Buyer shall do so by delivering written notice ("Exercise Notice") to Seller and to Escrow Holder (as defined below) of its election to so exercise at any time from and after July 1, 2003 and on or before August 29, 2003 (the "Option Exercise Period"). Upon exercise of the Option by Buyer, Seller shall sell and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, the Property on the terms and conditions contained herein.             1.4    _Failure to Exercise Option_. If, after closing pursuant to the Preliminary Closing, Buyer fails to exercise the Option prior to expiration of the Option Exercise Period, the Option shall automatically terminate and the provisions of Section 18.2 below shall apply.             1.5    _Deposit with Escrow_. The terms and conditions of the Option granted hereunder and Seller's sale of the Property to Buyer, and the instructions to Escrow Holder with regard to the escrow (the "Escrow") created pursuant hereto are as set forth in this Agreement.

During the term of the Option (and if exercised, until the Close of Escrow), in no event shall Seller directly or indirectly, voluntarily or by operation of law, sell, exchange, convey, transfer, contract to sell, dispose of, or further encumber the Property or any part thereof or any interest therein, or be divested of title to the Property or any part thereof or interest therein (individually or collectively, as the context may require, a "sale") without obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent may be given or withheld in Buyer's sole discretion. For purposes of this Section, the term "sale" shall include, without limitation, if Seller or a general partner or a member of Seller is a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or closely-held corporation, the issuance, sale, conveyance, transfer, disposition or encumbering of more than fifty pe rcent (50%) of any class of the currently issued and outstanding capital stock of Seller or of a general partner or member of Seller or of the beneficial interest of such partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or trust, or a change of any general partner or any member or any joint venture, either voluntarily, involuntarily or otherwise. For purposes of this Section, the term "closely-held corporation" shall mean any corporation not listed on any of the New York, American or Pacific stock exchanges. The transfer by any partner or member of Seller or by any direct or indirect interest holder in any partner or member of Seller, to the extent the transfer consists solely of an inter vivos gift or testamentary transfer to any spouse, parent, sibling, in-law, child or grandchild of such partner, member or interest holder, or to a trust for the benefit of such partner, member or interest holder, or such spouse, parent, sibling, in-law, child or grandchild of such partner, member or interest holder, shall not be deemed a "sale" for purposes of this Section. At Buyer's option, any sale of the Property or any part thereof in violation of this Section shall be deemed null and void. The restrictions set forth in this Section shall survive the exercise by Buyer of the Optio n and shall continue to the Close of Escrow, but shall terminate if Buyer does not timely exercise the Option.             1.7    _Existing Loan_.                     1.7.1    _Loan_. Seller informs Buyer that as of the date of this Agreement, the Property is encumbered by a Deed of Trust (the "Deed of Trust") dated August 19, 2001 executed by Seller for the benefit of Western Sierra National Bank ("Lender"), recorded as Document No. 2002-0100927 in the Official Records of Placer County, California and securing certain financing by Lender to Seller in the original principal amount of Twelve Million Seven Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars ($12,780,000) (the "Loan"). Any documents or instruments evidencing or securing the Loan are referred to herein as the "Loan Documents." Seller and Buyer acknowledge that Seller shall be required to pay off the Loan in full and remove all Loan Documents from title to the Property at the Close of Escrow.                     1.7.2    _Request for Notice of Default_. Seller and Buyer agree that Buyer may record in Placer County, California, one or more Requests for Notice of Default with respect to the Loan. Seller agrees that Buyer may cure any monetary default under the Loan on behalf of Seller.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no member of Seller, nor any direct or indirect partner, shareholder, manager officer, director, trustee or employee in or of any of them (each, a "Seller Nonrecourse Party," collectively, the "Seller Nonrecourse Parties"), shall be personally liable in any manner or to any extent under or in connection with this Agreement, and neither Buyer nor any successor, assignee, partner, officer, director or employee of Buyer shall have any recourse to any assets of a Seller Nonrecourse Party other than such party's interest in Seller to satisfy any liability, judgment or claim that may be obtained or made against any such Seller Nonrecourse Party under this Agreement or in conjunction with the Property. The limitation of liability provided in this subsection is in addition to, and not in limitation of, any limitation on liability applicable to a Seller Nonrecourse Party provided by law or by this Agreement or any other contract, agreement or instrument. Buyer agrees that it shall look solely to the assets of Seller for the enforcement of any claims arising hereunder or related hereto. The terms of this subsection are a material consideration and inducement to Seller to enter into this Agreement, and but for the inclusion of such provision in this Agreement, Seller would not enter into this Agreement.             17.4    _RELEASE_. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 17.4, BUYER, ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, DOES HEREBY FULLY AND FOREVER WAIVE, RELEASE AND DISCHARGE SELLER AND THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OF ANY NATURE OR SORT, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE, WHICH BUYER MAY HAVE WHICH ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE IN ANY WAY TO ANY LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INVESTIGATION, CLEAN-UP OR REMEDIATION OF ANY TOXIC OR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, ON, IN, UNDER OR ABOUT THE PROPERTY. THIS RELEASE SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS TO THE EXTENT: (I) THE SAME WAS CAUSED BY SELLER, OR ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR CONTRACTORS; (II) THAT SELLER HAS BREACHED ITS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OR COVENANTS IN THIS AGREEMENT; OR (III) SELLER HAS OTHERWISE AGREED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE EXHIBITS ATTACHED HERETO. BUYER AGREES THAT THIS RELEASE IS FULLY EFFECTIVE REGARDLESS OF ANY PRESENT LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE PART OF ANY PARTY AS TO ANY POSSIBLE CLAIM OR ANY FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES PERTAINING TO THIS MATTER. BUYER EXPRESSLY WAIVES THE BENEFITS AND PROVISIONS OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AND ANY SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTION. CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS:  > > A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.  >>  >>> > _             /s/            _  Signature of Buyer    _ARTICLE 18    TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT   _            18.1    _Termination Prior to Expiration of Contingency Period_. If Buyer fails to effectuate the Preliminary Closing for any reason, then this Agreement shall be terminated and neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any further rights or duties hereunder except for the following which are herein referred to as the "Continuing Duties":                     (i)    Buyer's indemnity obligations under Section 17;                     (ii)    Buyer shall return all Documents and Materials received and other things received from Seller;                     (iii)    Seller and Buyer shall execute and record, if necessary, any and all documents reasonably required to terminate the Option;                     (iv)    Seller and Title Company shall return to Buyer any monies deposited by Buyer; and                     (v)    All escrow cancellation fees shall be paid equally by Seller and Buyer.             18.2    _Liquidated Damages_. IF, AFTER BUYER'S EXERCISE OF THE OPTION, BUYER COMMITS A MATERIAL DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CLOSE OF ESCROW FAILS TO OCCUR BY REASON OF SUCH DEFAULT, THEN IN ANY SUCH EVENT, ESCROW HOLDER MAY BE INSTRUCTED BY SELLER TO CANCEL THE ESCROW, AND SELLER SHALL THEREUPON BE RELEASED FROM ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER. BASED UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW EXISTING, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH SELLER'S DAMAGES BY REASON OF BUYER'S DEFAULT. ACCORDINGLY, IN ADDITION TO SELLER'S RIGHT TO THE OPTION CONSIDERATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 1.9(iii) ABOVE, SELLER SHALL RETAIN THE OPTION CONSIDERATION AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER ITEMS DEFINED IN THIS SECTION 18.2. IF THE ESCROW AND THIS AGREEMENT ARE TERMINATED AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE LEASE AND THE DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT AND BUYER SHALL S TILL BE OBLIGATED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LEASE AND THE DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. SELLER AND BUYER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE APPLICABLE FOREGOING AMOUNT OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS REASONABLE AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND SHALL BE SELLER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER RELIEF, RIGHT OR REMEDY, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, TO WHICH SELLER MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED BY REASON OF BUYER'S DEFAULT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS 18.1(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) (WITH RESPECT TO ANY FUNDS OF BUYER HELD BY ESCROW HOLDER IN EXCESS OF THE OPTION CONSIDERATION) AND (v) SHALL APPLY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH, SELLER WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS WHICH SELLER OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE HAD UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 3389 TO SPECIFICALLY ENFORCE THIS AGREEMENT. SELLER AND BUYER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 18.2 AND BY THEIR INITIALS IMMEDIATELY BELOW AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS.                     Seller's Initials: _      /s/      _ Buyer's Initials: _      /s/  _  _        _18.3    _Default by Seller_. If the Preliminary Closing fails to close as a result of default by Seller, then Buyer's exclusive remedies shall be (i) to terminate this Agreement in which event the Option Consideration shall be returned to Buyer and neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any further rights or duties hereunder except for the Continuing Duties or (ii) to seek to cause Seller to specifically perform its obligations hereunder. If Escrow fails to close as a result of default by Seller, then Buyer's exclusive remedies shall be (i) to terminate this Agreement in which event the Option Consideration shall be returned to Buyer and neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any further rights or duties hereunder or (ii) Buyer may seek to cause Seller to specifically perform its obligations hereunder.     _  ARTICLE 19  __      DAMAGE OR CONDEMNATION BEFORE CLOSING    _            Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any casualty to the Property or any condemnation proceeding commenced before the Close of Escrow. In any such event, the rights and obligations of Seller and Buyer under this Option Agreement shall be as set forth in Section 10.3 of the Lease and in Article XI of the Lease (which provisions are incorporated herein by this reference and which references to the Lease shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement). If Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement if so permitted under such provisions, in addition to any other sums due Buyer by Seller, Buyer shall also be entitled to the return of the Option Consideration, and Escrow Holder shall promptly return such funds to Buyer upon receipt of such termination notice.       _ARTICLE 20    NOTICES   _            Any notice, demand, consent, approval, request or other communication, required or permitted to be given hereunder, shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been delivered (i) on the day personally delivered, (ii) upon receipt if sent by overnight courier, (iii) on the second business day following its mailing by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid, by deposit in the United States mail, or (iv) on the day received (if received by 5:00 p.m. local time on a business day [i.e., any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or California state or federal holiday] and if not so received then on the next business day) if sent by facsimile and then only if also sent to the recipient within forty-eight (48) hours pursuant to subparts (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 20, to the parties at the addresses set forth below:             if to Buyer:                                    Ace Hardware Corporation                                                              2200 Kensington Court                                                              Oak Brook, IL 60253                                                              Attn: Rich Sauck, Corporate Property Manager                                                              Facsimile: (630) 571-2186                                                                 - - and -                                                                 Ace Hardware Corporation                                                              2200 Kensington Court                                                              Oak Brook, IL 60253                                                              Attn: General Counsel                                                              Facsimile: (630) 990-6856             with a copy to:                              McDermott, Will & Emery                                                              18191 Von Karman Avenue, Suite 500                                                              Irvine, CA 92612                                                              Attn: Thomas K.
