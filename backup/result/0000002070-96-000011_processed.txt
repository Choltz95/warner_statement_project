Portions of the Registrant's definitive proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on October 31, 1996, are incorporated by reference into Part III. PART I ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - ----------------- BUSINESS The Registrant was duly organized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on April 26, 1946, as successor to a business founded in 1917. Its sole line of business is the design and manufacture of power conversion equipment for electronic and electrical systems. Principal markets encompass the computer, office copier, information systems, military, aerospace and communications industries and a variety of industrial, commercial and residential fields for applications that require conversion of electrical energy from one useable state to another. Products are distributed to customers through the Registrant's sales force, independent sales representatives and wholesale distributors. The business of the Registrant is not seasonal in nature. COMPETITION Competitive conditions within the power conversion industry are intense. The Registrant competes with many other companies, some of which have far greater resources than the Registrant. The principal methods of competition within the industry are price, service and product performance. To meet this competition, the Registrant attempts to maintain high standards of engineering, manufacturing and customer service. Due to the number and variety of competitors, reliable data relative to the Registrant's competitive position within the power conversion industry would be difficult to develop and is not known nor believed to exist. CUSTOMERS Power conversion equipment sales encompass markets wherein the demands of any one customer may vary greatly due to changes in technology and market strategy. One customer of the Company accounted for 14.8% of fiscal 1996 sales and 8.2% of June 30, 1996, accounts receivable. In comparison, two customers accounted for 13.4% and 10.6%, respectively, of fiscal 1995 sales, one of which also accounted for 10.6% of June 30, 1995, accounts receivable. There was one customer that accounted for 10.0% of fiscal 1994 sales. BACKLOG The backlog of orders believed to be firm totaled approximately $14,912,000 at June 30, 1996, compared with approximately $20,954,000 at June 30, 1995. The reduction in backlog from 1995 to 1996 is primarily due to the variability of the timing of orders received associated with one customer of the electronics business, a major original equipment manufacturer. As manufacture-cycle times have been reduced, customers have increased the frequency of orders, while, at the same time, reduced the time periods recovered. Further reduction in the backlog occurred as certain programs in the electronics business reached maturity, while new programs were in their infancy. Backlog orders at June 30, 1996, are generally expected to be filled during the current fiscal year. RAW MATERIALS The Registrant purchases materials in a semi-finished state from other manufacturers and distributors. Availability of materials is considered adequate to maintain current production levels. PATENTS The Registrant holds several technical patents and trademarks and is a party to certain patent applications. The extent of the effect of such patents and trademarks is, however, in the opinion of management, not material at this time. LICENSES The Registrant is a party to several license agreements. The only material license, providing for the sale and manufacture of a proprietary fiber nickel cadmium battery (FNC), is an agreement with Daug-Hoppecke Gesellschaft Fur Batteriesysteme mbH ("DAHO") of Brilon, Germany. The Company recorded an impairment loss write-off as of June 30, 1994, assigning zero value to the FNC license agreement. For further discussion, see attached referenced portions of the Registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders. EMPLOYEES As of June 30, 1996, approximately 743 persons were employed by the Registrant. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Approximately 7% of the Registrant's employees are engaged in engineering design and product development. Most new products are designed to satisfy specific customer requirements, and the cost of such development is expensed as incurred. Since satisfaction of many customers' needs requires advancing applicable technology, applied research is an integral part of engineering-design and product-development activities. The cost of such activities during the fiscal years ended June 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994, was $4,735,000, $4,791,000 and $5,666,000, respectively. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Registrant was informed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) on December 5, 1994, that the Municipal Waste Landfill, Cuba, NY, has been listed in the New York State Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites as a Class "2" site requiring remediation. Acme Electric Corporation has been determined by the DEC to be a potentially responsible party (PRP) by virtue of its disposal of wastes at the site. As a PRP, the Company may be subject to liability for the cost of site investigation and remediation. At this time, there is insufficient information available from which any reasonable estimate can be made of the potential relative costs to the Company. The Company did have insurance policies in effect during the period that waste was disposed of at the site, which the Company believes would provide coverage in the event the Company is liable. ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES - ------------------- The Registrant owns one plant in Lumberton, North Carolina, and leases a new (1994) plant in Cuba, New York (with an option to purchase in accordance with a $500,000 20-year industrial revenue bond financing), and leases facility space at second location in Cuba, New York, and plant and warehouse locations in Tempe, Arizona. The Registrant further owns an idle facility located in West Jordan, Utah, vacated and placed for sale in conjunction with its 1994 aerospace business restructuring. The Registrant believes that these facilities provide adequate capacity for its current operations.

PART II ITEM 5 - MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED SECURITY - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLDER MATTERS -------------- Information relating to the market and market prices of the Registrant's common stock, the approximate number of Registrant's shareholders and its dividend history for the past two fiscal years appears on page 24 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996, submitted herewith as an exhibit and such information is incorporated by reference herein. Information relating to long-term debt for the past two fiscal years appears on page 19 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996, submitted herewith as an exhibit and such information is incorporated by reference. The Registrant suspended its quarterly cash dividend effective the third quarter of fiscal 1991. The loss in fiscal 1991 resulted in a deficit of retained earnings. The Registrant, therefore, does not expect to reinstate dividends in the foreseeable future.

PAGE 10 OF ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIAL CONDITION: The Company has financed its working capital requirements and capital spending primarily with cash from operating revenues and the balance coming from increased borrowings. Total debt, including capital lease obligations, increased approximately $740,000 in 1996. During fiscal year 1996, the Company was able to reduce its net outstanding bank borrowings by $3,000,000, primarily due to the receipt of $2,025,000 of governmental loans and a $200,000 grant, all associated with the new Cuba, New York, facility. The working capital of the Company decreased by approximately $2,633,000 as of June 30, 1996. This reduction in working capital was primarily due to the Company's success in lowering inventory levels required to support operations, coupled with the collection of several aged Aerospace customer receivables and reductions of the unbilled receivables associated with engineering contracts in the military/aerospace business. A further contributing factor to the working capital decrease was the slight decline in June sales of electronics products to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), compared with the prior year June, resulting in a lower year-end receivables balance. ____________________________________________________________ Dollars in thousands ____________________________________________________________ Years ended June 30 1996 1995 1994 ____________________________________________________________ Working Capital $22,357 $24,990 $20,465 ____________________________________________________________ Average Working Capital, as a percent of sales 24.5% 24.9% 29.4% ____________________________________________________________ Cash provided from (used in) Operations 3,549 (605) 4,355 ____________________________________________________________ Current Ratio 2.7:1 2.7:1 3.0:1 ____________________________________________________________ Long-Term Debt to Equity 1.5:1 1.5:1 1.3:1 ____________________________________________________________ Capital expenditures and foreign investment combined were $3,963,000 and $4,272,000 for 1996 and 1995, respectively, compared with capital expenditures and license payments of $7,754,000 in 1994. Included in the 1996 expenditures is approximately $3,000,000, relating to the new business information system, of which $2,000,000 was financed through a third-party five-year lease arrangement. The fiscal 1995 and 1994 expenditures included $1,500,000 and $4,710,000, respectively, of the Cuba, New York, plant construction costs. The Company anticipates capital expenditures will approximate $2,700,000 in 1997, inclusive of the new business information system costs. The Company expects that operating activities in 1997 will produce net cash to fund these capital expenditures and any increase in working capital caused by increased business. At June 30, 1996, the Company had two secured term loans with a combined outstanding balance of $6,723,000, with interest terms of the lower of prime plus 1.5%, or 3% above the London Interbank Eurodollar rate, and a secured line of credit allowing for revolving loans and letters of credit up to $21,000,000 with interest at the lower of prime plus 1.0%, or the London Interbank Eurodollar rate plus 2.5%, with an outstanding balance of $13,288,000. The credit agreement, as amended, provides for a maturity date on the line of credit of December 1, 1997, while the $4,723,000 and $2,000,000 term loans have principal payments due through January 2, 2000, and July 1, 2001, respectively. Pursuant to requirements within the credit agreement, the Company has purchased an interest-rate protection instrument that provides for a maximum interest rate of 9.6% on $15,000,000 of notional principal debt, expiring December 1, 1997. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, maintenance of earnings, interest coverage, and debt-to-worth ratios. At June 30, 1996, the Company was in compliance of the covenants under the credit agreement. Management believes that current financing will provide adequate liquidity in the near term, with intentions to negotiate longer term facility commitments for the future. During 1996, the Company successfully concluded negotiations concerning amendments to its License Agreement ("License") with DAUG- HOPPECKE. Such amendments included issues pert  aining to the elimination of minimum royalties, extension of the License, expansion of eligible market applications, repair of products that exhibit certain defects, and the ability to assign the License to third parties. The Company has provided adequate accruals related to this agreement. The impact on 1997 cash flow will be less than $400,000.  PAGES 11 - 12 OF ANNUAL REPORT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: Acme Electric Corporation reported a net loss of $280,000, or $.06 per share, on net sales of $96,551,000 for the year ended June 30, 1996, compared with net income of $992,000, or $.20 per share, and net loss of $5,659,000, or $1.17 per share, for 1995 and 1994, respectively. The 1994 loss of $5,659,000 included a restructuring and impairment charge of $4,836,000 net of taxes, associated with the Company's restructuring of its aerospace business. Net loss from sales to the military/aerospace market for 1996 was $1,699,000, compared to losses of $1,219,000 and $2,377,000 in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Company continues to incur significant manufacturing inefficiencies and engineering contract overruns in its Tempe, Arizona, operation, as it strives to improve the product design processes and production disciplines, while endeavoring to stay current with customer shipment requirements to the military/aerospace market. Consolidated sales increased $5,424,000, or 5.9%, over the previous year, compared with an increase of $14,894,000, or 19.5%, in 1995 over 1994 levels. The increase is primarily the result of increased sales to two major customers, one in distribution, the second a major OEM customer. Sales to the military/aerospace market in 1996 were $7,698,000, approximately a $1,000,000 improvement over the 1995 and 1994 levels of $6,535,000 and $6,749,000, respectively. The Company achieved overall record annual sales in 1996, in spite of major disruptions in production and shipments in the second and third quarters, as new advanced manufacturing techniques were being introduced. The Company has continued to gradually recover the 1995 material-cost increases through increased pricing, though full recovery has not been realized. A portion of the 1996 sales growth was comprised of a mix of products with lower margins. Continued growth in sales will be dependent upon several factors, including the Company's ability to grow sales of its core line of products sold through distribution, along with the ability to minimize the short- term operational disruptions associated with the continued implementation of advanced manufacturing techniques and the new business system. The Company's sales progression will further be contingent upon the pace at which operational improvements at its Tempe, Arizona, manufacturing facility will be achieved, the success of its international sales efforts, and its ability to continue to attract new major OEM customer programs. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 77.6% in 1996, 74.4% in 1995, and 72.2% in 1994. The increase from 1995 to 1996 reflects the first full year at the higher material prices (incurred in 1995), which have cumulatively outpaced sales-price recovery efforts to date. Other factors adversely affecting 1996 gross margin (cost of sales) include: significant manufacturing cost inefficiencies and shipment disruptions in quarters two and three, as the Company initiated the implementation of new manufacturing techniques and resized its labor force at its Lumberton, North Carolina, manufacturing facility; continued operational difficulties with product design, product assembly processes and material flows experienced at its Tempe, Arizona, manufacturing facility, resulting in engineering contract- cost overruns and excessive production costs; and a slightly different mix of product sold with lower margin. These factors were partially offset by the $575,000 (Pre-tax) Sealed Lead Acid Battery (SLAB) contract loss reversal, resulting from the government's termination of the contract. The Company will continue to increase prices, where possible, in an effort to recover margins lost to the 1995 surge in material costs. Further, both the labor-force resizing and progress made in the Demand Flow Technology (DFT) implementation have favorably affected the commercial/industrial business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996. The Company's management resources continue to be taxed by the military/aerospace business in an effort to achieve break-even results in the near term. The success of these efforts will be contingent on product pricing initiatives, improvement in the design processes and production activities, and growth in sales. The cost of sales as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 was 77.7%, an improvement from the 81.5% of the second quarter, in spite of significant engineering contract losses and large workers' compensation claims charged in the quarter. This improvement reflects the favorable efforts of the aforementioned Company initiatives. Research and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales were 4.9% in 1996, compared to 5.2% in 1995 and 7.4% in 1994. This net decrease as a percentage of sales is reflective of the higher sales level achieved in 1996 over 1995. Included in the 1994 expenses was approximately $250,000 of engineering and quality support costs, which are included in manufacturing expense in 1996 and 1995. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 15.5% in 1996, compared with 16.5% in 1995 and 18.8% in 1994. The percentage of sales decrease from 1995 to 1996 is primarily due to the increased sales levels in 1996 without a corresponding increase in selling costs, including commissions. The net decrease in the percent of sales ratio from 1994 to 1995 reflects the nearly $15,000,000 growth in sales in 1995, coupled with the $600,000 reduction in overhead costs resulting from the 1994 aerospace business restructuring. Total interest expense increased nearly $400,000 from 1995 to 1996. This increase is primarily due to a higher average outstanding debt balance maintained during 1996 to support the working capital requirements of the Company. Total interest expense decreased by approximately $560,000 from 1994 to 1995. However, included in the 1994 interest amount was approximately $1,160,000 of costs associated with the interest collar instrument. Interest costs had increased in 1995 over 1994 amounts when the 1994 collar-related amounts are excluded, due primarily to higher interest rates combined with higher average outstanding debt balances in 1995. The Company's long-term debt originates from financing the military/aerospace business over the past nine years. Effective tax (benefit) rates for the most recent three years were (29.7%), 38.4% and (35.3%), respectively. The fluctuations in the effective rates are generally reflective of the year-to-year variations in the permanent book-to- tax differences as a percent of pre-tax earnings (loss) and the Company's estimations as to the probable realizations of certain deferred state tax assets and minimum tax effects thereon. The Company does not record tax benefit for the loss from its 50%-owned foreign joint-venture and, as such, has generated a lower effective benefit rate. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 1996 resulted in net income of $148,000 on quarterly sales of $24,040,000, or a net income per share of $.03. The pre-tax income for the quarter of $190,000 included a $175,000 reversal of the remaining loss reserve related to the SLAB contract with the Department of the Navy (terminated for convenience), a $316,000 additional charge for workers' compensation costs, and $480,000 accrued losses on long-term engineering contracts for the military/aerospace market. Annual workers' compensation costs were approximately $340,000 higher than normal, primarily due to several major individual case developments which occurred in the fourth quarter of the year. The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting of Stock-Based Compensation," will become effective for the Company for fiscal year 1997. SFAS No. 123 establishes a fair- value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation, but does not require entities to adopt that method in place of the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." The Company is evaluating its alternative with respect to the adoption of this Statement.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES: a. Acme Electric Corporation designs, manufactures and markets power conversion equipment for electronic and electrical systems. Principal markets encompass computers, test equipment, information systems, military, aerospace, telecommunications and a variety of industrial, commercial and residential applications requiring conversion of electrical energy from one useable state to another. b. The Company is a 50% owner in the Irish-based joint-venture, Acme Electric Limited (AEL). This investment is recorded under the equity method of accounting. As of June 30, 1996, the Company's share of cumulative losses approximated $375,000. c. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The major areas in which the Company utilizes estimates include deferred tax assets, reserves for insurance and legal claims, environmental liabilities, product warranty reserves, reserve recognition on long-term contracts, and the net realizable value of certain assets. The amounts contained within these financial statements represent management's best estimate of expected outcomes based on available information. However, the Company realizes that certain events could occur or fail to occur which would impact the estimates by a material amount in the future. d. The Company files a federal income tax return and various state returns. The Company follows the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial carrying values and the tax bases of the related assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision for the period is the difference in the assets and liabilities as of the beginning and end of the period. Income taxes are more fully described in Note 7. e. Inventories are costed at the lower of cost or market and determined principally on a FIFO (first in, first out) basis. f. The Company utilizes the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in its aerospace business. Revenues are recognized on the percentage-of- completion basis, measured by the percentage of material, labor and overhead costs incurred to date to total estimated material, labor and overhead costs for each long-term contract. g. Except for facilities held for sale, depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed on the straight-line and the sum-of-the- years'-digits methods over the estimated service lives of the assets. At the time of retirement or other disposition of properties, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gains or losses are reflected in income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; renewals and betterments are capitalized. The range of lives used as a basis for calculating depreciation is as follows: Years ______________________________________ Buildings 20-45 ______________________________________ Machinery and equipment 5-12 ______________________________________ Furniture and fixtures 8-10 ______________________________________ Automobiles and trucks 3-4 ______________________________________ h. Net income (loss) per common share computations are based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year as adjusted for outstanding stock options. 2.

This credit agreement is comprised of two secured term loans in the amount of $4,723,044 and $2,000,000 and a $21,000,000 secured revolving loan. The revolving loan carries an interest rate equal to the lower of prime plus 1.0%, or the London Interbank Eurodollar rate plus 2.5%, with a maturity date of December 1, 1997. The Company maintains interest rate protection, which allows for a maximum interest rate of 9.6% on $15,000,000 of notional principal debt. Outstanding borrowings against the revolving credit facility are limited by formula to specified amounts of accounts receivable and inventory, reduced by outstanding term debt. The Company pays a maximum annual commitment fee of 1/4 of 1% per annum on the unused portion. Under the terms of the credit agreement, the Company is required to meet certain restrictive covenants with respect to maintenance of earnings, interest coverage and debt-to-worth ratios. At June 30, 1996, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. During the next five years, long-term debt matures as follows: 1997 - $2,206,000, 1998 - $2,281,000, 1999 - $2,318,000, 2000 - $2,322,000, and 2001 - $2,064,000. These amounts do not include any maturities relating to the revolving loan. 5.

The federal tax loss carry forward of $3,000,000 will have portions expire, if unused, in 2009. Portions of the state loss carry forwards, if not used, will expire in 1997. 8. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS RETIREMENT PLANS: The Company maintains three noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees. The plan covering salaried employees provides pension benefits based upon the employee's individual yearly compensation. Plans covering hourly employees provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. It is the Company's policy to fund for each qualified plan at least an amount necessary to satisfy the minimum requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The amount to be funded is subject to annual review by management and its consulting actuary. In recent years, funding contributions have been restricted due to application of Internal Revenue Code full-funding limitations to one or more of the plans. The Company also maintains a nonqualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for elected executive officers of the Company. The SERP provides benefits based upon an executive's compensation in the last year of service and is reduced by benefits received from the salaried plan. Six participants of this plan are retired and receiving payments under the plan. Approximately 3% of the plans' assets are invested in cash and equivalents, 50% are invested in equities, and the remaining 47% are invested in fixed-income securities and annuities. Net periodic pension expense for the three years ended June 30, 1996, included the following components: _________________________________________________________________ Dollars in thousands 1996 1995 1994 _________________________________________________________________ Service cost - Benefits earned during the period $ 518 $ 521 $ 562 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 1,521 1,441 1,382 Actual return on assets (4,666) (1,398) (1,078) Net amortization, deferral and curtailment gain 2,885 (505) (977) Net periodic pension expense (income) $ 258 $ 59 $ (111) _________________________________________________________________ For plans where: June 30, 1996 June 30, 1995 Assets Accumulated Assets Accumulated Exceed Benefits Exceed Benefits Accumulated Exceed Accumulated Exceed Benefits Assets Benefits Assets _________________________________________________________________ Actuarial present value of benefit obligations: Vested benefit obligation $(18,568) $(1,359) $(17,434) $ 0 Accumulated benefit obligation (18,718) (2,751) (17,530) (1,205) Projected benefit obligation (20,082) (2,771) (18,716) (1,313) Plan assets at fair value 25,173 1,350 23,108 0 Funded Status: Assets in excess of (or less than) projected benefit obligation 5,090 (1,421) 4,392 (1,313) Transition (asset) or obligation (645) 273 (871) 414 _________________________________________________________________ Unrecognized prior service cost 2,947 161 2,832 0 Unrecognized net gain (5,107) (73) (4,086) (80) Accrued (prepaid) pension cost $ (2,285) $ 1,060 $ (2,267) $ 979 _________________________________________________________________ Pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" (SFAS 87), the Company has recorded $382,000 of additional unfunded accumulated benefit obligation attributable to the SERP plan at June 30, 1996. These unfunded obligations are recorded in other long-term liabilities. In addition, an intangible asset of the same amount has also been recorded. At June 30, 1996, and 1995, the discount rates for the benefit obligations were 7.0% and 7.5%, respectively, the assumed annual rate of increase in future compensation used in determining the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations was 4.5% for plans covering the salaried employees for both years, and the expected long-term annual rate of return on plan assets was 8.5% for plan years 1996 and 1995. OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS: The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employees' Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," in 1994. The Company maintains a nonqualified benefits plan to include post-retirement health care for elected officers of the Company. Six participants of this plan are retired and receiving payments under the plan. The Accumulated Post-Retirement Benefit Obligation at June 30, 1996, and 1995, was comprised of $453,000 and $450,000, respectively, attributable to retirees, and $57,000 and $53,000, respectively, attributable to eligible and other active plan participants, for combined totals of $510,000 and $503,000, respectively. At June 30, 1996, and 1995, the unrecognized amount of the Accumulated Post-Retirement Benefit Obligation was $368,000 and $226,000, respectively. The fiscal 1996 Net Periodic Post- Retirement Benefit Cost associated with the plan was $68,000, comprised of $6,000 service costs, $38,000 interest costs, $22,000 amortization of the transition obligations, and $2,000 amortization of unrecognized net loss. The fiscal 1995 Net Periodic Post-Retirement Benefit Cost associated with the plan was $63,000, comprised of $5,000 services costs, $36,000 interest costs, and $22,000 of amortization of the transition obligation. The accrued Post- Retirement Benefit Cost recognized in the balance sheet as June 30, 1996, was $86,000, as compared to June 30, 1995, of $57,000. At June 30, 1996, and 1995, the assumed discount rates were 7.0% and 7.5%, respectively, used in the calculation of the benefit obligations, assumed annual health-care trend rate is 6.0% for both years, with claim costs to increase based upon age, ranging from .5% to 6.0% per annum. POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS The Company has evaluated the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 (SFAS 112), "Employers' Accounting for Post- Employment Benefits." SFAS 112 establishes accounting standards for employers who provide benefits to former or inactive employees, their beneficiaries, and covered dependents, after employment but before retirement. The Company provides post-employment benefits only to employees who are involuntarily terminated as a result of organizational restructuring or downsizing. Excluded from this  benefit is facility closures. These benefits are limited to severance pay based upon length of service. The Company has not accrued for these post- employment benefits based upon historical data indicating a relatively stable work force, the relatively minor amounts paid in past years, and the fact that these costs cannot be reasonably estimated with any degree of certainty. 9. MAJOR CUSTOMERS: Power conversion equipment sales encompass markets wherein the demands of any one customer may vary greatly due to changes in technology and market strategy. One customer of the Company accounted for 14.8% of fiscal 1996 sales and 8.2% of June 30, 1996, accounts receivable. In comparison, two customers accounted for 13.4% and 10.6%, respectively, of fiscal 1995 sales, one of which also accounted for 10.6% of June 30, 1995, accounts receivable. There was one customer that accounted for 10.0% of fiscal 1994 sales. 10. RESTRUCTURING: In 1994, the Company recognized a pre-tax charge of $7,475,000 against earnings to establish reserves and record the impairment of assets associated with the restructuring of its aerospace business to include the closing of the Acme-URDC, Inc. facility in West Jordan, Utah, and the consolidation of operations into the facility in Tempe, Arizona. The only remaining restructing-related reserve at June 30, 1996, is the reserve for the URDC plant write-down of $399,000. The Company continues to actively market, for sale or lease, the idle 23,000-square- foot facility in West Jordan, Utah. 11. SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN: The Company's Board of Directors has adopted a shareholders' rights plan (the "Rights Plan") and declared a dividend of one Right for each two shares of the Company's Common Stock outstanding at December 6, 1993. The Rights do not become exercisable until the earlier of (i) ten days following the public announcement that a person or affiliated group (an "Acquiring Person") has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, or (ii) ten days following the commencement of a tender offer, or exchange offer, that would result in a person or affiliated group becoming an Acquiring Person. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a purchase price of $50.00 per share. In the event that, at any time following the Distribution Date, (i) the Company is the surviving corporation in a merger with an Acquiring Person and its Common share is not changed or exchanged, (ii) a Person becomes the beneficial owner of more than 20% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, (iii) an Acquiring Person engages in one or more "self-dealing" transactions as set forth in the Rights Agreement between the Company and its transfer agent, or (iv) during such time as there is an Acquiring Person, an event occurs which results in such Acquiring Person's ownership interest being increased by more than 1% (e.g., a reverse stock split), each holder of the Rights will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, Common Stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Rights. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, following the occurrence of any of the events set forth in this paragraph, all Rights that are, or (under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement) were, beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person will be null and void. 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: The Company was informed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) on December 5, 1994, that the Municipal Waste Landfill, Cuba, NY, has been listed in the New York State Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites as a Class "2" site requiring remediation. Acme Electric Corporation has been determined by the DEC to be a potentially responsible party (PRP) by virtue of its disposal of wastes at the site. As a PRP, the Company may be subject to liability for the cost of site investigation and remediation. At this time, there is insufficient information available from which any reasonable estimate can be made of the potential relative costs to the Company. The Company did have insurance policies in effect during the period that waste was disposed of at the site, which the Company believes would provide coverage in the event the Company is liable.

Robert J. McKenna, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated that, "We are gratified by continued sales increases resulting in record sales for the year. We continue our recovery from losses incurred in the second quarter due to the costs of implementing Demand Flow Technology (DFT) in manufacturing operations and due to unusually high material cost increases." Mr. McKenna added that, "We look forward to improved performance in future periods as DFT yields operating gains and margins improve as prices are increased in selected markets."
