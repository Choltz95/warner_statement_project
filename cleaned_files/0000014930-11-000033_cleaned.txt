BRUNSWICK CORPORATION INDEX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K December 31, 2010 TABLE OF CONTENTS PART I Item 1. Business Refer to Note 5 - Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s segments, including net sales, operating earnings and total assets by segment for 2010, 2009 and 2008. Marine Engine Segment The Marine Engine segment, which had net sales of $1,807.4 million in 2010, consists of the Mercury Marine Group (Mercury Marine). The Company believes its Marine Engine segment has the largest dollar sales volume of recreational marine engines in the world, along with a leading parts and accessories business. To promote advanced propulsion systems with improved and easier handling, performance and efficiency, Mercury Marine, both directly and through its joint venture, CMD, manufactures and markets advanced boat and engine steering and control systems under the brand names of Zeus and Axius. Mercury Marine’s parts and accessories distribution businesses include: Land ‘N’ Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply and Diversified Marine Products. These businesses are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities.

The Boat Group’s products are sold to end-users through a global network of approximately 2,000 dealers and distributors, each of which carries one or more of Brunswick’s boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group’s largest dealer, MarineMax Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group’s product lines, represented approximately 20 percent of Boat Group sales in 2010. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year. Fitness Segment Brunswick’s Fitness segment is comprised of its Life Fitness division (Life Fitness), which designs, manufactures and markets a full line of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness and Hammer Strength brands. The Fitness segment’s principal manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and Hungary. Life Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Life Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the first and fourth calendar quarters of the year. Bowling & Billiards Segment The Bowling & Billiards segment is comprised of the Brunswick Bowling & Billiards division (BB&B), which had net sales of $323.3 million during 2010. The Company believes BB&B is a leading worldwide full-line designer, manufacturer and marketer of bowling products.

BB&B’s sales are seasonal with sales generally highest in the first and fourth calendar quarters of the year. Financial Services The term of the BAC joint venture extends through June 30, 2014. The joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or purchase of the joint venture by either of the parties at the end of this term. Alternatively, either partner may allow the agreement to terminate at the end of its term. Refer to Note 9 – Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Company’s financial services. Brunswick utilizes distributors, dealers and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of its boat sales and significant portions of its sales of marine engine, fitness and bowling and billiards products. Brunswick has over 15,000 Dealers serving its business segments worldwide. Brunswick’s marine Dealers typically carry boats, engines and related parts and accessories. Brunswick owns Land ‘N’ Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply and Diversified Marine Products, which are the primary parts and accessories distribution platforms for the Company’s Marine Engine segment. These businesses are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 13 distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities. Brunswick’s Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell Brunswick’s products exclusively, while others also carry competitors’ products. Brunswick partners with its boat dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer’s experience. International Operations Brunswick’s sales to customers in markets other than the United States were $1,403.3 million (41 percent of net sales), $1,168.7 million (42 percent of net sales) and $2,058.5 million (44 percent of net sales) in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company transacts most of its sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, and the cost of its products is generally denominated in U.S. dollars. Strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of Brunswick’s non-U.S. operations. Non-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 5 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details Brunswick’s non-U.S. sales by region: Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 51 percent of Brunswick’s non-U.S. sales in 2010. The segment’s primary non-U.S. operations include the following: Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 24 percent of Brunswick’s non-U.S. sales in 2010. The Boat Group’s products are manufactured or assembled in the United States, Canada, China, Mexico, Portugal and the United Kingdom, as well as boat plants in Argentina and Poland that perform contract manufacturing for the Company, and are sold worldwide through dealers. The Boat Group has sales offices in France, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Singapore. Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 20 percent of Brunswick’s non-U.S. sales in 2010. Life Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment also manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets. Bowling & Billiards segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 5 percent of Brunswick’s non-U.S. sales in 2010. BB&B sells its products worldwide, has sales offices in Germany, Hong Kong and Tokyo, and operates plants that manufacture automatic pinsetters in Hungary and bowling balls in Mexico. BB&B operates retail bowling centers in Austria, Canada and Germany. Raw Materials and Supplies Brunswick purchases a wide variety of raw materials from its supplier base, including oil, aluminum, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise the Company’s production costs, which could reduce the Company’s profitability if the Company cannot recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. Additionally, some components used in Brunswick’s manufacturing processes, including engine blocks and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers currently face or may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply Brunswick with the parts and components it needs, which could significantly disrupt Brunswick’s operations. The Company also continues to expand its global procurement operations to better leverage its purchasing power across its divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. The Company mitigates its commodity price risk by using derivatives to hedge a portion of its raw material purchases. Intellectual Property Brunswick has, and continues to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of its products and processes. By law, Brunswick’s patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. The Company believes that its patent rights are important to its competitive position in all of its business segments. In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to interiors and other boat features and components. In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling. In the Bowling & Billiards segment, patent rights principally relate to computerized bowling scorers and bowling center management systems, bowling center furniture, bowling lanes, lane conditioning machines and related equipment, bowling balls, and billiard table designs and components. The following are Brunswick’s primary trademarks: Marine Engine Segment:  Attwood, Axius, Diversified Marine Products, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land ‘N’ Sea, Mariner, MercNET, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Parts Express, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Quicksilver, Rayglass, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, SportJet, Swivl-Eze, Valiant, Verado and Zeus. Boat Segment:  Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Cabo, Crestliner, Cypress Cay, FloteBote, Harris, Hatteras, Lowe, Lund, Master Dealer, Meridian, Princecraft, Sea Ray, Sealine and Trophy. Fitness Segment:  Flex Deck, Hammer Strength, Lifecycle and Life Fitness. Bowling & Billiards Segment:  Air Hockey, Ballworx, Brunswick, Brunswick Billiards, Brunswick Pavilion, Brunswick Zone, Brunswick Zone XL, Centennial, Contender, Cosmic Bowling, Frameworx, Gold Crown, Inferno, Lightworx, Pro Lane, U.S. Play by Brunswick, Vector, Viz-A-Ball and Zone. Brunswick’s trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets. Competitive Conditions and Position The Company believes that it has a reputation for quality in each of its highly competitive lines of business. Brunswick competes in its various markets by utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising and sales efforts; providing high-quality products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket services. Strong competition exists in each of Brunswick’s product groups, but no single enterprise competes with Brunswick in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. Brunswick also competes with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities, but do not compete directly with Brunswick’s products. The following summarizes Brunswick’s competitive position in each segment: Marine Engine Segment:  The Company believes it has the largest dollar sales volume of recreational marine engines in the world, along with a leading parts and accessories business. The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, as well as several smaller companies. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution. Research and Development Number of Employees The number of employees worldwide is shown below by segment: Environmental Requirements See Item 3 of this report for a description of certain environmental proceedings.

Risk Factors The Company’s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of the Company’s common stock. Worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Europe, have adversely affected the Company’s industries, businesses and results of operations and may continue to do so.  The economic factors discussed above have also reduced the ability of fitness centers and bowling retail centers to invest in new equipment, which has adversely affected sales in the Company’s Fitness and Bowling & Billiards segments. Although consumer credit markets have improved, tight consumer credit markets have reduced demand, especially for marine products, and may continue to do so. The inability of the Company’s dealers and distributors to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect the Company’s sales. The Company’s financial results may be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective distribution. The Company relies on third-party dealers and distributors to sell the majority of its products, particularly in the marine business.  The ability to maintain a reliable network of dealers is essential to the Company’s success.  The Company faces competition from other boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of the Company’s dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results. Adverse economic, credit and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company does not frequently utilize short-term capital markets to meet its working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs; however, the Company does maintain short-term borrowing facilities which can be used to meet these capital requirements.  In addition, over the long term, the Company may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives. Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility and heightened governmental regulation could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.  This could adversely affect the Company’s ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on its business, financial results and competitive position. Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers and independent boat builders could adversely affect the Company’s financial results. Excess supply of repossessed and aged boats can adversely affect industry pricing. The Company may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers. The Company has agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to the Company’s customers to enable the purchase of its products.  In connection with these agreements, the Company may have obligations to either repurchase the Company’s products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer’s receivables.  These obligations are triggered if the Company’s dealers default on their debt obligations to the finance companies. The loss of key accounts or critical suppliers could harm the Company’s business.  The Company’s success depends upon the continued strength of its brands.  The Company believes that its brands, including Brunswick, Mercury, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, Hatteras and Life Fitness, are significant contributors to the success of the Company’s business and that maintaining and enhancing the brands are important to expanding the Company’s customer base.  Failure to protect the Company’s brands from infringers may adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company’s businesses have a large fixed cost base that can affect its profitability in a declining sales environment. The high levels of fixed costs of operating marine production plants can put pressure on profit margins. The Company’s profitability is dependent, in part, on its ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if the Company makes a decision to reduce its rate of production, as it did in 2008 and 2009, gross margins could be negatively affected. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower the Company’s ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact its results of operations. Successfully establishing a smaller manufacturing footprint is critical to the Company’s operating and financial results. The Company’s inability to successfully implement its restructuring initiatives and other uncertainties could negatively affect the Company’s liquidity position, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company relies on third-party suppliers for the supply of the raw materials, parts and components necessary to manufacture its products.  The Company’s financial results may be adversely affected by an increase in cost, disruption of supply or shortage of or defect in raw materials, parts or product components. The Company’s pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside its control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory changes. Higher energy costs can adversely affect the Company’s results, especially in the marine and retail bowling center businesses. The Company’s profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures. In addition, the Company’s independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick’s own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for the Company’s products. The Company’s ability to remain competitive depends on the successful introduction of new product offerings and the ability to meet our customers’ expectations. The Company competes with a variety of other activities for consumers’ scarce discretionary income and leisure time. The vast majority of the Company’s products are used for recreational purposes, and demand for the Company’s products can be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’ time, including other forms of recreation as well as religious, cultural and community activities. The decrease in discretionary income as a result of the recent economic environment has reduced consumers’ willingness to purchase and enjoy the Company’s products.  The Company manufactures and sells products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury and property damage claims and litigation. Environmental laws and zoning and other requirements can inhibit the Company’s ability to grow its marine businesses. The Company’s businesses may be adversely affected by compliance obligations and liabilities under various laws and regulations. Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose the Company to additional tax liability.  Although the Company carefully monitors changes in tax laws and works to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact the Company’s financial results. Additionally, the Company is subject to laws governing its relationship with its employees, including, but not limited to, employee wage and hour and benefit issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits.  Changes to such legislation could increase the cost of the Company’s operations. Compliance with environmental regulations affecting marine engines will increase costs and may reduce demand for the Company’s products. The Company’s common stock price may fluctuate due to a variety of factors.   The violatility and price of the Company’s common stock may be affected by numerous factors, including changes to generally accepted accounting principles and financial reporting standards. Such developments could materially affect the Company’s financial results and the way that investors perceive the Company’s performance.  If the Company’s intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use its technologies and thereby reduce the Company’s ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations. Some of the Company’s operations are conducted by joint ventures that it cannot operate solely for its benefit. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect the Company’s results. Although the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to reduce its risk related to currency exchange fluctuations, it is impossible to hedge against all currency risk, especially over the long term, and changes in the relative values of currencies may occur from time to time and, in some instances, affect the Company’s results of operations.  The Company is also exposed to the risk that its counterparties to hedging contracts could default on their obligations, which may have an adverse effect on the Company. A growing portion of the Company’s revenue may be derived from international sources, which exposes it to additional uncertainty. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect the Company’s consolidated results of operations and net worth. The Company also continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill, and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable.  The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable. Adverse weather conditions can have a negative effect on marine and retail bowling center revenues. Instability in locations where the Company maintains a significant presence could adversely impact the Company’s business operations. Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. The occurrence of natural and environmental disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and environmental spills, could decrease consumer demand for and sales of the Company’s products.  In the event that such an occurrence takes place in one of Brunswick’s major sales markets, the Company could experience a decrease in sales.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near the Company’s business or manufacturing facilities, the affected locations could experience an interruption in business operations and/or their operating systems. The Company’s operations are dependent upon the services of key individuals, the loss of whom could materially harm us. The Company’s business operations could be negatively impacted by the failure of its information technology systems. The Company’s global business operations are managed through a variety of information technology (IT) systems, some of which are legacy systems with a minimal level of support, which the Company plans to replace over a period of years.  If one of these legacy systems, or another of the Company’s key IT systems were to suffer a failure, or if the Company’s differing IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales, or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.

Legal Proceedings German Tax Audit As the result of a German tax audit for years 1998 through 2001, the Company’s German subsidiary received a proposed audit adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2009, which is being contested by the Company, related to the shutdown of the subsidiary’s pinsetter manufacturing operation and sale of the subsidiary’s pinsetter assets to a related subsidiary.

The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the above summary.    Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Company includes non-GAAP financial measures in Management’s Discussion and Analysis, as Brunswick’s management believes that these measures and the information they provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view Brunswick’s performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the Company’s ongoing business performance. Certain other statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from expectations as of the date of this filing because of factors discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview and Outlook In 2010, Brunswick continued to operate in a difficult economy and marine industry, while positioning itself to take advantage of market opportunities as they evolve, and maintaining its strategic objective to solidify its leadership position in the marine, fitness and bowling and billiards industries, by: Actions taken in support of the Company’s strategic objectives in 2010 included:  Restructuring Activities Total restructuring, exit and impairment charges recorded during 2010, 2009 and 2008 for each of the Company’s reportable segments are summarized below: See Note 2 – Restructuring Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.  The Company anticipates it will incur approximately $15 million of additional charges in 2011 related to known restructuring activities initiated in 2010 or 2009.  Goodwill and Trade Name Impairments Brunswick assesses the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Outlook for 2011 The Company expects to have positive earnings per share in 2011 resulting from increased revenues and the expected strong operating earnings leverage resulting from its transformed manufacturing footprint and cost structure.  The Company is also expecting net earnings in 2011 to benefit from previously announced marine plant consolidation activities, and lower restructuring, exit and impairment charges, net interest, depreciation and pension expenses.  A modest increase in the Company’s tax provision is expected to negatively impact net earnings in 2011.  Matters Affecting Comparability The following events have occurred during 2010, 2009 and 2008, which the Company believes affect the comparability of the results of operations: Restructuring, exit and impairment charges. The Company implemented initiatives to improve its cost structure, better utilize overall capacity and improve general operating efficiencies. During 2010, the Company recorded charges of $61.2 million related to these restructuring activities as compared with $172.5 million during 2009 and $177.3 million during 2008. See Note 2 – Restructuring Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.    Investment sale gains. In March 2008, the Company sold its interest in its bowling joint venture in Japan for $40.4 million gross cash proceeds, $37.4 million net of cash paid for taxes and other costs. The sale resulted in a $20.9 million pretax gain, $9.9 million after-tax, and was recorded in Investment sale gains in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In September 2008, the Company sold its investment in a foundry located in Mexico for $5.1 million gross cash proceeds. The sale resulted in a $2.1 million pretax gain and was recorded in Investment sale gains in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Tax items. The Company recognized an income tax provision of $25.9 million during 2010, which generally relates to foreign and state jurisdictions where the Company is in a tax paying position.  In addition, the tax provision during 2010 includes a charge of $1.8 million, primarily related to the reassessment of unrecognized tax benefits.    During 2008, the Company recognized a tax provision of $155.9 million on a Loss before income taxes of $632.2 million for an effective tax rate of (24.7) percent. Typically, the Company would recognize a tax benefit on operating losses; however, due to the uncertainty of the realization of certain net deferred tax assets, a provision of $338.3 million was recognized to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. See Note 10 – Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The Company also recorded a Loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2010 and 2009 of $5.7 million and $13.1 million, respectively. The losses on the early extinguishment of debt reflect premiums paid to retire $36.2 million and $96.6 million of its 11.75 percent Senior notes due 2013 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  There was no comparable charge in 2008.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain amounts, ratios and relationships calculated from the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: bpts = basis points NM = not meaningful (A)       Gross margin is defined as Net sales less Cost of sales as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 2010 vs. 2009 The increase in gross margin percentage in 2010 compared with 2009 was mainly due to lower discounts required to facilitate retail boat sales, higher fixed-cost absorption and greater efficiencies resulting from increased production rates required by greater wholesale demand in the marine businesses, as well as lower pension expense and the realization of successful cost-reduction efforts. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $75.7 million to $549.4 million in 2010. The decrease was mainly a result of reduced pension and bad debt expense and successful cost-reduction efforts.    During 2010, the Company incurred trade name impairment charges of $1.1 million related to the divestiture of the Company’s Triton fiberglass boat brand.  The Company did not incur impairment charges related to its trade names in 2009.  See Note 3 – Goodwill and Trade Name Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The improvement in operating earnings (loss) was mainly due to the factors discussed above. Equity loss decreased $12.7 million to a loss of $3.0 million in 2010, from a loss of $15.7 million in 2009. The decrease in equity loss primarily resulted from improved financial results of the Company’s marine joint ventures.  Interest expense increased $8.3 million to $94.4 million in 2010 compared with 2009, predominantly as a result of higher average outstanding debt levels in 2010 and increased borrowing rates resulting from debt refinancing activities in the third quarter of 2009.  The Company also realized a $5.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during 2010 as it paid a premium to retire $36.2 million of its 11.75 percent Senior notes due 2013.  The loss on early extinguishment of debt during 2009 totaled $13.1 million. The Company recognized an income tax provision of $25.9 million during 2010, which generally relates to foreign and state jurisdictions where the Company is in a tax paying position.  In addition, the tax provision during 2010 includes a charge of $1.8 million, primarily related to the reassessment of unrecognized tax benefits. Net loss and Diluted loss per common share improved in 2010 when compared with 2009 due to all the factors discussed above. Weighted average common shares outstanding used to calculate Diluted loss per common share increased to 88.7 million in 2010 from 88.4 million in 2009. No shares were repurchased during 2010 or 2009.   2009 vs. 2008 Sales outside the United States in 2009 decreased to $1,168.7 million from $2,058.5 million in 2008, with the largest reduction in international sales coming from Europe, which decreased $506.0 million to $518.1 million.  The decrease in international sales impacted all segments at rates relatively consistent with the domestic reductions. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $43.3 million to $625.1 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily driven by successful cost reduction initiatives, which were partially offset by higher variable compensation, pension and bad debt expense.  During 2009, the Company did not incur impairment charges related to its goodwill and trade names. In 2008, the Company incurred $511.1 million of impairment charges related to its goodwill and trade names. See Note 3 – Goodwill and Trade Name Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The decrease in operating loss was mainly due to the absence of goodwill and trade name impairment charges in 2009 and successful cost reduction efforts, partially offset by reduced sales volumes, along with lower fixed-cost absorption and the absence of variable compensation and defined contribution accruals in 2008. Equity earnings (loss) decreased $22.2 million to a loss of $15.7 million in 2009. The decrease in equity earnings was mainly the result of lower earnings from the Company’s marine joint ventures.  In 2009, the Company did not sell any investments.  During 2008, Brunswick sold its interest in its bowling joint venture in Japan for $40.4 million gross cash proceeds and its investment in a foundry located in Mexico for $5.1 million gross cash proceeds. These sales resulted in $23.0 million of pretax gains. During 2008, the Company recognized a tax provision of $155.9 million on operating losses of $632.2 million for an effective tax rate of (24.7) percent. Typically, the Company would recognize a tax benefit on operating losses; however, due to the uncertainty of the realization of certain net deferred tax assets, a provision of $338.3 million was recognized to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. See Note 10 – Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Net loss and Diluted loss per share were lower in 2009 when compared with 2008 primarily due to all the factors discussed above. Weighted average common shares outstanding used to calculate Diluted loss per share increased to 88.4 million in 2009 from 88.3 million in 2008. No shares were repurchased during 2009 or 2008.    The Company operates in four reportable segments: Marine Engine, Boat, Fitness and Bowling & Billiards.  Refer to Note 5 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the operations of these segments. Marine Engine Segment The following table sets forth Marine Engine segment results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: NM = not meaningful 2010 vs. 2009 Restructuring, exit and impairment charges recognized during 2010 and 2009 were chiefly related to restructuring activities associated with the Company’s consolidation of its engine production as discussed in Note 2 – Restructuring Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Marine Engine segment operating earnings of $147.3 million increased by $278.5 million compared with 2009 performance as a result of higher sales volumes, lower bad debt expense, lower restructuring, exit and impairment charges, lower pension expense, fixed-cost savings from successful cost reduction efforts and improved fixed-cost absorption on higher production. Capital expenditures in 2010 were generally related to tooling, plant consolidation activities and profit-maintaining investments.  Capital expenditures in 2009 were primarily related to profit-maintaining investments. 2009 vs. 2008 Net sales recorded by the Marine Engine segment decreased compared with 2008, primarily due to the continued reduction in global marine retail demand and the corresponding decline in wholesale shipments. Despite the poor economic climate, sales in the segment’s domestic marine service, parts and accessories businesses, which represented 31 percent of the total segment sales for 2009, only experienced a single-digit percentage decline in sales when compared with 2008. As a result of its impairment analysis of goodwill and trade names, Brunswick incurred trade name charges within the Marine Engine segment during 2008. There were no comparable charges in 2009. See Note 3 – Goodwill and Trade Name Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Capital expenditures in 2009 and 2008 were primarily related to profit-maintaining investments and were lower during 2009 as a result of discretionary capital spending constraints.    Boat Segment The following table sets forth Boat segment results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: NM = not meaningful 2010 vs. 2009 The Boat segment recorded a trade name impairment charge of $1.1 million in 2010 associated with the divestiture of its Triton fiberglass boat brand.  No trade name impairment charges were recorded in 2009. The Boat segment’s operating loss decreased from 2009 mainly as a result of higher sales volumes, reduced retail incentive programs, lower restructuring, exit and impairment charges, higher fixed-cost absorption and successful cost reduction initiatives. Capital expenditures in 2010 and 2009 were largely related to tooling costs for the production of new models and profit-maintaining investments.  2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in Boat segment net sales was largely the result of the continued reduction in marine retail demand in global markets and lower shipments to dealers in an effort to achieve appropriate levels of pipeline inventories, as well as higher dealer incentive programs and sales discounts. Weak retail market conditions, paired with the Company’s objective of protecting its dealer network by selling fewer units at wholesale than were being sold by the dealers at retail, resulted in approximately 50 percent fewer unit sales when compared to 2008. No goodwill and trade name impairment charges were recognized in 2009.  This compares to the goodwill and trade name impairment charges in 2008, which were primarily the result of its impairment analysis performed during the third quarter of 2008. See Note 3 – Goodwill and Trade Name Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.    The Boat segment’s operating loss decreased from 2008 primarily due to the absence of goodwill and trade name impairment charges that were taken in 2008, as well as savings from successful cost-reduction initiatives.  This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in sales volume, lower fixed-cost absorption, higher dealer incentive programs and sales discounts, the absence of variable compensation and defined contribution accruals in 2008, and increased restructuring, exit and impairment charges. Capital expenditures in 2009 were largely attributable to tooling costs for the production of new models and profit maintaining capital. Capital spending was lower during 2009 as a result of discretionary capital spending constraints and a smaller manufacturing footprint. Fitness Segment The following table sets forth Fitness segment results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: bpts = basis points NM = not meaningful 2010 vs. 2009 Fitness segment net sales increased in 2010 when compared to 2009 primarily due to increased purchases of new equipment by global commercial customers and consumer customers in international markets.  International sales, representing 52 percent of the Fitness segment’s sales during 2010, experienced a 13 percent increase when compared with 2009. The Fitness segment’s operating earnings were positively affected in 2010 by higher sales, favorable product and customer mix, lower material costs, higher fixed-cost absorption and lower restructuring, exit and impairment charges.    Capital expenditures in 2010 and 2009 were primarily limited to profit-maintaining investments. 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in Fitness segment net sales was largely attributable to reduced volume of worldwide commercial equipment sales, as gym and fitness club operators delayed purchasing new equipment and deferred building new fitness centers as a result of general economic weakness and reduced credit availability. Commercial and consumer equipment sales in the United States and Canada declined approximately 23 percent compared to 2008, while other international sales decreased approximately 20 percent. The restructuring, exit and impairment charges recognized during 2009 were primarily related to employee severance and other benefits charges. Restructuring, exit and impairment charges recorded during 2008 included asset write-downs and employee severance and other benefits charges. See Note 2 – Restructuring Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The Fitness segment operating earnings were negatively affected in 2009 by lower worldwide sales volumes of both commercial equipment and consumer equipment as well as the absence of variable compensation and defined contribution accruals in 2008. Operating earnings were favorably impacted by the savings from successful cost-reduction measures and reduced restructuring, exit and impairment charges.    2009 capital expenditures were primarily related to profit-maintaining investments and were lower compared to 2008 as a result of discretionary capital spending constraints.    Bowling & Billiards Segment The following table sets forth Bowling & Billiards segment results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: bpts = basis points NM = not meaningful  2010 vs. 2009 Net sales decreased in 2010 when compared with 2009 mainly due to lower bowling retail equivalent-center sales and reduced billiards business volumes.  The bowling products business remained relatively flat in 2010 when compared with 2009.  International sales, representing 23 percent of the segment’s sales during 2010, experienced a one percent increase when compared with 2009. Restructuring, exit and impairment charges decreased in 2010 when compared with 2009 primarily as a result of the completion of the sale of the Company’s Valley-Dynamo coin-operated commercial billiards business in 2009. The Company incurred approximately $4 million of exit costs related to the sale of the Valley-Dynamo business in 2009. Operating earnings improved by $9.4 million during 2010 as a result of lower pension expense, incremental savings from successful cost-reduction efforts, lower restructuring, exit and impairment charges and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by lower bowling retail equivalent-center sales volumes and other definite-lived asset impairments recorded during 2010. Capital expenditures in 2010 and 2009 were related to profit-maintaining investments for existing bowling retail centers. 2009 vs. 2008 The goodwill and trade name impairment charges in 2008 were primarily the result of the Company’s impairment analysis performed during the third quarter of 2008. The remaining charges related to the Valley-Dynamo business. There were no comparable charges in 2009. See Note 3 – Goodwill and Trade Name Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The increase in 2009 operating earnings (loss) was the result of the absence of $14.4 million and $8.5 million of goodwill and trade name impairment charges, respectively, reduced restructuring, exit and impairment charges, as well as savings from successful cost-reduction initiatives. These factors were partially offset by the effect of lower sales, higher pension expense and the absence of variable compensation and defined contribution accruals in 2008. Decreased capital expenditures in 2009 were driven primarily by reduced spending for new Brunswick Zone XL centers and constraints on capital spending for existing centers.   The following table sets forth charges for restructuring activities undertaken at Corporate for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: NM = not meaningful The restructuring, exit and impairment charges recognized during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were related to write-downs and disposals of non-strategic assets and severance charges. See Note 2 – Restructuring Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.  Cash Flow, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth an analysis of free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Brunswick’s major sources of funds for investments, acquisitions and dividend payments are cash generated from operating activities, available cash balances and selected borrowings. The Company evaluates potential acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures in the ordinary course of business. 2010 Cash Flow 2009 Cash Flow 2008 Cash Flow The Company used $10.8 million of net cash in its financing activities during 2008, reflecting net issuances of short-term debt of $7.4 million and a $4.4 million dividend payment.  The Company also issued $250 million of notes due in 2013 to retire the $250 million of notes due in 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company views its highly liquid assets for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 as: The following table sets forth an analysis of net debt for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: The following table sets forth an analysis of total liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:  The Company has a $400.0 million secured, asset-based revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) in place with a group of banks through May 2012, as described in Note 14 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no loan borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility in 2010 or 2009. The Company has the ability to issue up to $150.0 million in letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company pays a facility fee of 75 to 100 basis points per annum, which is based on the daily average utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility.  The aggregate funded status of the Company’s qualified pension plans, measured as a percentage of the projected benefit obligation, was approximately 63 percent in 2010 compared with approximately 62 percent in 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the Company’s qualified pension plans were underfunded on an aggregate projected benefit obligation basis by $431.8 million. See Note 15 – Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Financial Services BFS recorded income related to the operations of BAC of $2.7 million, $3.1 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts include amounts earned by BFS under the aforementioned income sharing agreement, but exclude the discount expense paid by the Company in 2009 on the sale of Mercury Marine’s accounts receivable to the joint venture noted below.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees. The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with guarantees and repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. Historical cash requirements and losses associated with these obligations have not been significant. See Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these arrangements. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth a summary of the Company’s contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2010: Legal Proceedings See Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure related to certain legal and environmental proceedings. Environmental Regulations Critical Accounting Policies Reserve for Excess and Obsolete Inventories. The Company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value. Fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions, historical usage rates, model changes and new product introductions. If model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions, the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted. The Company recognized $61.2 million, $172.5 million and $177.3 million in restructuring, exit and impairment charges in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which are discussed in more detail in Note 2 - Restructuring Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    Litigation. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to claims and litigation, including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment, made in consultation with counsel, of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim. In light of existing reserves, the Company’s litigation claims, when finally resolved, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position. Postretirement Benefit Reserves. Postretirement costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions, including the discount rate, the estimated future return on plan assets, the annual rate of increase in compensation for plan employees, the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors. The Company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company evaluates the pronouncements of various authoritative accounting organizations, primarily the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF), to determine the impact of new pronouncements on GAAP and the impact on the Company.  The following are recent accounting pronouncements that have been adopted during 2010 or have not yet been adopted: Consolidation:  In June 2009, the FASB amended the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) applicable to variable interest entities by changing the criterion used to conclude whether such an entity should be consolidated. The amendment was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this ASC amendment on January 1, 2010 resulted in the Company expanding its disclosures relative to its variable interest entity, as reflected in Note 9 – Financial Services. Revenue Recognition:  In October 2009, the FASB amended the ASC to addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. The amendment is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the ASC amendment may have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Transfers and Servicing:  In June 2009, the FASB amended the ASC by modifying the derecognition guidance of transferred and serviced financial assets and liabilities. The ASC amendment was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this amendment on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Subsequent Events:  In February 2010, the FASB further amended the ASC to resolve conflicts with SEC reporting requirements surrounding subsequent events.  The adoption of this ASC amendment on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  Forward-Looking Statements Placing undue reliance on the Company’s forward-looking statements should be avoided, as the forward-looking statements represent the Company’s views only as of the date this Annual Report is filed. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the Company’s management. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Raw materials used by the Company are exposed to the effect of changing commodity prices. Accordingly, the Company uses commodity swap agreements, futures contracts and supplier agreements to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials, including aluminum and natural gas. The amounts shown below represent the estimated reduction in fair market value that the Company would incur on its derivative financial instruments from a 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency rates, and commodity prices.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. These estimates affect: – The reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; – The disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and – The reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to: – Allowances for doubtful accounts; – Inventory valuation reserves; – Reserves for dealer allowances; – Warranty related reserves; – Losses on litigation and other contingencies; – Environmental reserves; – Insurance reserves; – Income tax reserves; – Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets; – Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets; – Reserves related to repurchase and recourse obligations; – Impairments of long-lived assets; – Reserves related to restructuring activities; and – Postretirement benefit liabilities. The Company records a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company establishes its reserve based on its best estimate within a range of losses. If the Company is unable to identify the best estimate, the Company records the minimum amount in the range. Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Other investments, over which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and for which there is not a readily determinable market value, are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments, and at December 31, 2010 and 2009, such investments were recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Advertising Costs. Advertising and promotion costs are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the advertising first takes place. Advertising and promotion costs were $34.8 million, $33.8 million and $62.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Foreign Currency. The functional currency for the majority of Brunswick’s operations is the U.S. dollar. All assets and liabilities of operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at current rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.  Revenues and expenses of operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Stock-Based Compensation. The Company accounts for all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the income statement based upon their fair values. Share-based employee compensation costs are recognized as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 16 – Stock Plans and Management Compensation for a description of the Company’s accounting for stock-based compensation plans.    Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Derivatives. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its risk associated with movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. These instruments are used in accordance with guidelines established by the Company’s management and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. See Note 12 – Financial Instruments for further discussion. Recent Accounting Pronouncements. The Company evaluates the pronouncements of various authoritative accounting organizations, primarily the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF), to determine the impact of new pronouncements on GAAP and the impact on the Company.  The following are recent accounting pronouncements that have been adopted during 2010 or have not yet been adopted: Consolidation:  In June 2009, the FASB amended the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) applicable to variable interest entities by changing the criterion used to conclude whether such an entity should be consolidated. The amendment was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this ASC amendment on January 1, 2010 resulted in the Company expanding its disclosures relative to its variable interest entity, as reflected in Note 9 – Financial Services. Revenue Recognition:  In October 2009, the FASB amended the ASC to address the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. The amendment is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the ASC amendment may have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Transfers and Servicing:  In June 2009, the FASB amended the ASC by modifying the derecognition guidance of transferred and serviced financial assets and liabilities. The ASC amendment was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this amendment on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Subsequent Events:  In February 2010, the FASB amended the ASC to resolve conflicts with SEC reporting requirements surrounding subsequent events.  The adoption of this ASC amendment on January 1, 2010 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 2 – Restructuring Activities The costs incurred under these initiatives include: Restructuring Activities – These amounts mainly relate to: Exit Activities – These amounts mainly relate to: Asset Disposition Actions – These amounts mainly relate to sales of assets and definite-lived asset impairments of: The following table is a summary of the expense associated with the restructuring, exit and impairment activities for 2010, 2009 and 2008.  The 2010 charges consist of expenses related to actions initiated in 2010, 2009 and 2008.  The 2009 charges consist of expenses related to actions initiated in 2009 and 2008.  The 2008 charges consist of expenses related to actions initiated in 2008.

Note 3 – Goodwill and Trade Name Impairments Brunswick assesses the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company recorded $1.1 million of trade name impairment charges during 2010 in connection with the divestiture of its Triton fiberglass boat brand.  Refer to Note 2 – Restructuring Activities for further discussion.  However, the Company did not record any goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments during the annual impairment testing in 2010 and 2009. The following table summarizes the goodwill impairment charges: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  The following table summarizes the trade name impairment charges: A summary of changes in the Company’s goodwill during the period ended December 31, 2010, by segment follows: A summary of changes in the Company’s goodwill during the period ended December 31, 2009, by segment follows: Adjustments in 2010 and 2009 relate to the effect of foreign currency translation on goodwill denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Other intangibles consist of the following: Note 4 –Loss per Common Share Basic loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated similarly, except that the calculation includes the dilutive effect of stock options and Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), collectively “options,” and non-vested stock awards. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are calculated as follows: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 5 – Segment Information Brunswick is a manufacturer and marketer of leading consumer brands, and operates in four reportable segments: Marine Engine, Boat, Fitness and Bowling & Billiards. The Company’s segments are defined by management reporting structure and operating activities. The Marine Engine segment manufactures and markets a full range of sterndrive engines, inboard engines, outboard engines and marine parts and accessories, which are principally sold directly to boat builders, including Brunswick’s Boat segment, or through marine retail dealers worldwide. Mercury Marine also manufactures and distributes boats in certain markets outside the United States. The Company’s engine manufacturing plants are located primarily in the United States, China and Japan, with sales primarily to North American, European and Asian markets. The Boat segment designs, manufactures and markets fiberglass pleasure boats, offshore fishing boats, aluminum fishing boats, pontoon and deck boats, which are sold primarily through dealers. The Boat segment’s products are manufactured primarily in the United States. Sales to the segment’s largest boat dealer, MarineMax, which has multiple locations, comprised approximately 20 percent of Boat segment sales in 2010, approximately 16 percent in 2009 and approximately 13 percent in 2008. The Company evaluates performance based on business segment operating earnings. Operating earnings of segments do not include the expenses of corporate administration, earnings from unconsolidated equity affiliates, other expenses and income of a non-operating nature, interest expense and income, loss on early extinguishment of debt or provisions for income taxes. Corporate/Other results include items such as corporate staff and administrative costs. Corporate/Other total assets consist of mainly cash and investments in marketable securities, deferred and prepaid income tax balances and investments in unconsolidated affiliates.  Marine eliminations are eliminations between the Marine Engine and Boat segments for sales transactions consummated at established arm’s length transfer prices. Information as to the operations of Brunswick’s operating segments is set forth below: Operating Segments Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Geographic Segments Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 6 – Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There is a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable. The following table summarizes Brunswick’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010: The following table summarizes Brunswick’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009: Refer to Note 12 – Financial Instruments for additional information related to the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities by class.  In addition to the items shown in the table above, see Note 15 – Postretirement Benefits for further discussion regarding the fair value measurements associated with the Company’s postretirement benefit plans.  Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 7 – Financing Receivables The following are the Company’s financing receivables, excluding trade accounts receivable contractually due within one year, by segment as of December 31, 2010: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 8 – Investments Investments in Marketable Securities The following is a summary of the Company’s available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2010: The net carrying value and estimated fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2010, by contractual maturity, are shown below: There were no sales or redemptions of available-for-sale securities in 2010. The net adjustment to Unrealized investment gains on available-for-sale securities included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was ($0.1) million in 2010.  Total available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2009 were $0.8 million and consisted of U.S. Treasury Bills. The majority of the unrealized losses relates to changes in interest rates and market spreads subsequent to purchase. The Company does not consider the credit-related unrealized losses on its debt securities to be material. The securities that have unrealized losses are Corporate and Agency Bonds that are highly-rated.    Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Equity Investments The Company has certain unconsolidated international and domestic affiliates that are accounted for using the equity method. Refer to Note 9 – Financial Services for more details on the Company’s Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC joint venture. The Company contributed $12.4 million and $0.7 million to other existing joint ventures in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The Company did not make any contributions to other existing joint ventures in 2008. Brunswick received dividends from its unconsolidated affiliates of $2.4 million, $0.3 million and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company’s sales to and purchases from its equity investments, along with the corresponding receivables and payables, were not material to the Company’s overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, and its financial position as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. In March 2008, Brunswick sold its interest in its bowling joint venture in Japan for $40.4 million gross cash proceeds, $37.4 million net of cash paid for taxes and other costs. The sale resulted in a $20.9 million pretax gain, $9.9 million after-tax, and was recorded in Investment sale gains in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In September 2008, Brunswick sold its investment in a foundry located in Mexico for $5.1 million gross cash proceeds. The sale resulted in a $2.1 million pretax gain and was recorded in Investment sale gains in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Note 9 – Financial Services Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  The Company’s maximum loss exposure relating to BAC is detailed as follows: BFS recorded income related to the operations of BAC of $2.7 million, $3.1 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in Equity earnings (loss) and Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These amounts include amounts earned by BFS under the aforementioned income sharing agreement, but exclude the discount expense paid by the Company in 2009 and 2008 on the sale of Mercury Marine’s accounts receivable to the joint venture as noted below. Note 10 – Income Taxes The sources of earnings (loss) before income taxes were as follows: The income tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Temporary differences and carryforwards giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009, were as follows: At December 31, 2010, tax credit carryforwards totaling $148.6 million were available to reduce future tax liabilities.  This deferred tax asset was comprised of $58.4 million related to foreign tax credits, $57.5 million related to general business credits, $2.4 million related to miscellaneous other federal credits, and $30.3 million of various state tax credits related to research and development, capital investment, and job incentives.  The above credits expire at various intervals between the years 2011 and 2032. The Company has historically provided deferred taxes for the presumed ultimate repatriation to the United States of earnings from all non-U.S. subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates. The indefinite reversal criterion allows the Company to overcome that presumption to the extent the earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 the Company had $36.9 million, $45.9 million and $44.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, respectively. Of these amounts, $35.0 million, $42.2 million, and $37.0 million, respectively, represent the portion that, if recognized, would impact the Company’s tax provision and the effective tax rate.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 the Company had $4.9 million, $6.0 million and $6.9 million accrued for the payments of interest, respectively, and no amounts accrued for penalties. The following is a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties for the 2010 and 2009 annual reporting periods: The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010 will decrease by approximately $14 million in 2011 as a result of expected settlements with taxing authorities. Due to the various jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns and the uncertainty regarding the timing of the settlement of tax audits, it is possible that there could be other significant changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in 2011, but the amount cannot be estimated. The difference between the actual income tax provision (benefit) and the tax benefit computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to loss before income taxes is attributable to the following: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies Financial Commitments In most instances, upon repurchase of the debt obligation, the Company receives rights to the collateral securing the financing. The Company’s risk under these arrangements is mitigated by the value of the collateral that secures the financing. The Company had $6.0 million and $4.4 million accrued for potential losses related to recourse exposure at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company has also entered into arrangements with third-party lenders where it has agreed, in the event of a default by the customer, to repurchase from the third-party lender Brunswick products repossessed from the customer. These arrangements are typically subject to a maximum repurchase amount. The amount of collateral the Company could be required to repurchase as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was: The Company’s risk under these repurchase arrangements is mitigated by the value of the products repurchased as part of the transaction.  The Company had $1.7 million and $9.0 million accrued for potential losses related to repurchase exposure at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The Company’s repurchase accrual represents the expected losses resulting from obligations to repurchase products, after giving effect to proceeds anticipated to be received from the resale of those products to alternative dealers. The Company has recorded the fair value of its estimated net liability associated with losses from these guarantee and repurchase obligations on its Consolidated Balance Sheets based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances.  Historical cash requirements and losses associated with these obligations have not been significant, but could increase if dealer defaults rise beyond current expectations. Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Product Warranties The following activity related to product warranty liabilities was recorded in Accrued expenses at December 31: Legal and Environmental German Tax Audit As the result of a German tax audit for years 1998 through 2001, the Company’s German subsidiary received a proposed audit adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2009, which is being contested by the Company, related to the shutdown of the subsidiary’s pinsetter manufacturing operation and sale of the subsidiary’s pinsetter assets to a related subsidiary.  Environmental Matters Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Asbestos Claims Brazilian Customs Dispute Note 12 – Financial Instruments The Company operates globally, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world. Due to the Company’s global operations, the Company engages in activities involving both financial and market risks. The Company utilizes normal operating and financing activities, along with derivative financial instruments, to minimize these risks. Fair Value Hedges. During 2010 and 2009, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure related to changes in the value of assets or liabilities caused by changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies. The change in the fair value of the foreign currency derivative contract and the corresponding change in the fair value of the asset or liability of the Company are both recorded through earnings (loss), each period as incurred. A cash flow hedge requires that as changes in the fair value of derivatives occur, the portion of the change deemed to be effective is recorded temporarily in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, an equity account, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2010, the term of derivative instruments hedging forecasted transactions ranged from one to 13 months. The following activity related to cash flow hedges was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Foreign Currency. The Company enters into forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure related to forecasted transactions, and assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from changes in foreign currency rates. These include: product costs; revenues and expenses; associated receivables and payables; intercompany obligations and receivables; and other related cash flows. As of December 31, 2010, the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments were: As of December 31, 2009, the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments were: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  The effect of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, was: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  The effect of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, was: Note 13 – Accrued Expenses Accrued Expenses at December 31 were as follows: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 14 – Debt Short-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: Long-Term Debt at December 31 consisted of the following: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 15 – Postretirement Benefits  The Company’s domestic pension and retiree health care and life insurance benefit plans, which are discussed below, provide benefits based on years of service and, for some plans, average compensation prior to retirement. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for these plans. The Company’s foreign postretirement benefit plans are not significant individually or in the aggregate. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The Company’s postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost do not reflect the effects of the Act, as the Company does not anticipate qualifying for the subsidy based on its current plan designs. Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Costs. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs included the following components for 2010, 2009 and 2008:   Benefit Obligations and Funded Status. A reconciliation of the changes in the plans benefit obligations and fair value of assets over the two-year period ending December 31, 2010, and a statement of the funded status at December 31 for these years for the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans follow: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  The amounts included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, were as follows:  The projected and accumulated benefit obligations for the Company’s pension plans were in excess of plan assets for all plans.  The projected and accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for the Company’s qualified and nonqualified pension plans at December 31 were as follows: The funded status of these pension plans includes the projected and accumulated benefit obligations for the Company’s unfunded, nonqualified pension plan of $42.0 million and $42.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company’s nonqualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are not funded. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). The following pretax activity related to pensions and other postretirement benefits was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Other Postretirement Benefits. Once participants eligible for other postretirement benefits turn 65 years old, the health care benefits become a flat dollar amount based on age and years of service.  The assumed health care cost trend rate for other postretirement benefits for pre-age 65 benefits as of December 31 was as follows: The health care cost trend rate assumption has an effect on the amounts reported. A one percent change in the assumed health care trend rate at December 31, 2010, would have the following effects: The Company monitors the cost of health care and life insurance benefit plans and reserves the right to make additional changes or terminate these benefits in the future. Assumptions. Weighted average assumptions used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at December 31 were as follows: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the years ended December 31 were as follows: The Company utilized a yield curve analysis to determine the discount rates for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The yield curve consists of spot interest rates at half yearly increments for each of the next 30 years and was developed based on pricing and yield information for high quality corporate bonds rated Aa by Moody’s, excluding callable bonds, bonds of less than a minimum size and other filtering criteria. The yield curve analysis matched the cash flows of the Company’s benefit obligations. The Company evaluates its assumption regarding the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience, future expectations of investment returns, anticipated asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment professionals. The Company’s long-term rate of return on assets assumptions of 7.5 percent for 2010, 8.0 percent for 2009, and 8.5 percent for 2008, reflects expectations of projected weighted average market returns for the plans’ assets. Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  The Trust asset allocation at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and target allocations for December 31, 2010 were as follows: The fair values of the Trust’s pension assets at December 31, 2010, by asset class were as follows: Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  The fair values of the Trust's pension assets at December 31, 2009, by asset class were as follows: The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value: Equity securities: The indexed equity funds are valued at the net asset value (NAV) provided by the investment managers. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding. Other equity securities are valued at quoted market price of securities if available, otherwise the securities are valued using a pricing model developed by the investment managers. Corporate debt securities: Corporate debt securities are valued using proprietary pricing models used by the investment managers, which are based on estimated prices at which a dealer would pay for or sell a security. Government debt securities: U.S. Treasury bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. Other agency securities are valued based on proprietary pricing models used by investment managers, which are based on estimated prices at which a dealer would pay for or sell a security. Short-term investments, commingled funds: Short-term investments and commingled funds are valued at the NAV provided by the investment managers. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding. Real estate: The limited partnership real estate fund is valued at the NAV using information received from investment managers or the audited financial statements. These NAVs are calculated using valuation models developed by the investment managers and independent third-party appraisers. The limited partnership real estate fund represents a closed-end fund where the Master Trust receives distributions when the underlying assets of the fund are liquidated. It is anticipated that the remaining underlying assets of the fund will be fully liquidated in 2011.

The expected cash flows for the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans follow: The Company also provides postemployment benefits to qualified former or inactive employees. The pretax prior service credits in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) recognized in income was $1.3 million in both 2010 and 2009. The estimated pretax prior service credit in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2010, expected to be recognized in income in 2011, is $1.3 million.    Brunswick Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 16 – Stock Plans and Management Compensation Under the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (Plan), the Company may grant stock options, SARs, non-vested stock and other types of share-based awards to executives and other employees.

The fair value of each grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model utilizing the following weighted average assumptions for 2010, 2009 and 2008:    Total stock option and SARs expense was $13.0 million, $8.4 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Non-vested stock awards The Company grants non-vested stock units and awards to key employees as determined by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Non-vested stock units and awards have vesting periods of three or four years. Non-vested stock units and awards are eligible for dividends, which are reinvested and non-voting. All non-vested units and awards have restrictions on the sale or transfer of such awards during the non-vested period. Generally, grants of non-vested stock units and awards are forfeited if employment is terminated prior to vesting. Non-vested stock units and awards granted in 2006 and later vest pro rata if the sum of (A) the age of the grantee and (B) the grantee’s total number of years of service equals 70 or more. The cost of non-vested stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. During December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, there was $2.1 million, $0.6 million and $2.0 million charged to compensation expense for non-vested stock awards, respectively. The weighted average price per non-vested stock award at grant date was $11.44, $10.71 and $15.66 for the non-vested stock awards granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Non-vested stock award activity for all plans for the three years ended December 31 was as follows: As of December 31, 2010, there was $1.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan.
